#PSI|NAME|CATEGORY|TYPE|ACTION|RANGE|DURATION|STRAIN_MOD|SKILL|DESC
PSI|Ambience Sense|Chi|Passive|Automatic|Self|Constant|||This sleight provides the async with an instinctive sense about an area and any potential threats nearby. The async receives a +10 modifier to all Investigation, Perception, Scrounging, and Surprise Tests.|||||||
PSI|Cognitive Boost|Chi|Active|Quick|Self|Temp (Action Turns)|-1|-0|The async can temporarily elevate their cognitive performance. In game terms, Cognition is raised by 5 for the chosen duration. This boost to Cognition also raises the rating of skills linked to that aptitude.|||||||
PSI|Downtime|Chi|Active|Task (min. 4 hours)|Self|Sustained|0|-0|This sleight provides the async with the ability to send the mind into a fugue-state regenerative downtime, during which the character's psyche is repaired. The async must enter the downtime for at least 4 hours; every 4 hours of downtime heals 1 point of stress damage. Traumas, derangements, and disorders are unaffected by this sleight. For all sensory purposes, the async is catatonic during downtime, completely oblivious to the outside world. Only severe disturbances or physical shock (such as being wounded or hit by a shock weapon) will bring the async out of it.|||||||
PSI|Emotion Control|Chi|Passive|Automatic|Self|Constant||-0|Emotion Control gives the async tight control over their emotional states. Unwanted emotions can be blocked out and others embraced. This has the benefit of protecting the async from emotional manipulation, such as the Drive Emotion sleight or Intimidation skill tests. The async receives a +30 modifier when defending against such tests.|||||||
PSI|Enhanced Creativity|Chi|Passive|Automatic|Self|Constant||-0|An async with Enhanced Creativity is more imaginative and more inclined to think outside the box. Apply a +20 modifier to any tests where creativity plays a major role. This level of ingenuity can sometimes seem strange and different, manifesting in odd or creepy ways, especially with artwork.|||||||
PSI|Filter|Chi|Passive|Automatic|Self|Constant||-0|Filter allows the async to filter out out distractions and eliminate negative situational modifiers from distraction, up to the gamemaster's discretion.|||||||
PSI|Grok|Chi|Active|Complex|Self|Instant|-1|-0|"By using the Grok sleight, the async is able to intuitively understand how any unfamiliar object, vehicle, or device is used simply by looking at and handling it. If the character succeeds in a COG x 2 Test, they achieve a basic ability to use the object, vehicle, or device, no matter how alien or bizarre. This sleight does not provide any understanding of the principles or technologies involved""the psi user simply grasps how to make it work. If a test is called for, the psi user receives a +20 modifier to use the device (this bonus only applies to unfamiliar devices, and/or tests the character is defaulting on""it does not apply to devices the character is familiar with)."|||||||
PSI|High Pain Threshold|Chi|Passive|Automatic|Self|Constant||-0|This sleight allows the async to block out, ignore, or otherwise isolate pain. The async reduces negative modifiers from wounds by 10.|||||||
PSI|Hyperthymesia|Chi|Passive|Automatic|Self|Constant||-0|Hyperthymesia grants the async a superior autobiographical memory, allowing them to remember the most trivial of events. A hyperthymestic async can be asked a random date and recall the day of the week it was, the events that occurred that day, what the weather was like, and many seemingly trivial details that most people would not be able to recall.|||||||
PSI|Instinct|Chi|Passive|Automatic|Self|Constant||-0|Instinct bolsters the async's subconscious ability to gauge a situation and make a snap judgment that is just as accurate as a careful, considered decision. For Task Actions that involve analysis or planning alone (typically Mental skill actions), the async may reduce the timeframe by 90% without suffering a modifier. For Task Actions that involve partial analysis/planning, they may reduce the timeframe by 30% without penalty.|||||||
PSI|Multitasking|Chi|Passive|Automatic|Self|Constant||-0|The async can handle vast amounts of information without overload and can perform more than one mental task at once. The character receives an extra Complex Action each Action Phase that may only be used for mental or mesh actions.|||||||
PSI|Pattern Recognition|Chi|Passive|Automatic|Self|Constant||-0|"The character is adept at spotting patterns and correlating the non-random elements of a jumble""related items jump out at them. This is useful for translating languages, breaking codes, or find clues hidden among massive amounts of data. The character must have a sufficiently large sample enough time to study, as determined by the gamemaster. This might range from a few hours of listening to a spoken transhuman language to a few days of investigating inscriptions left by long-dead aliens to a week or more of researching a lengthy cipher. Languages may be comprehended by reading or listening to them being spoken. Apply a +20 modifier to any appropriate Language, Investigation, Research, or code-breaking Tests (note that this does not apply to Infosec Tests made by software to decrypt a code). The async may also use this ability to more easily learn new languages, reducing the training time by half."|||||||
PSI|Predictive Boost|Chi|Passive|Automatic|Self|Constant||-0|The Bayesian probability machine features of the async's brain are boosted by this sleight, enhancing their ability to estimate and predict outcomes of events around them as they unfold in real-time and update those predictions as information changes. In effect, the character has a more intuitive sense for which outcomes are most likely. This grants the character a +10 bonus on any skill tests that involve predicting the outcome of events. It also bolsters the async's decision-making in combat situations by making the best course of action more clear, and so provides a +10 bonus to both Initiative and Fray Tests.|||||||
PSI|Qualia|Chi|Active|Quick|Self|Temp (Action Turns)|-1|-0|The async can temporarily increase their intuitive grasp of things. In game terms, Intuition is raised by 5 for the chosen duration. This boost to Intuition also raises the rating of skills linked to that aptitude.|||||||
PSI|Savant Calculation|Chi|Passive|Automatic|Self|Constant||-0|The character possesses an incredible facility with intuitive mathematics. They can do everything from calculate the odds exactly when gambling to predicting precisely where a leaf falling from a tree will land by observing the landscape and local wind currents. The character specializes in calculation involving the activity of complex chaotic systems and so can calculate answers that even the fastest computers could not, including things like patterns of rubble distribution from an explosion. However, this mathematic facility is largely intuitive, so the character does not know the equations they are solving, they merely know the solution to the problem. This sleight also provides a +30 modifier to any skill tests involving math (which the character is calculating, not a computer).|||||||
PSI|Sensory Boost|Chi|Active|Quick|Self|Temp (Action Turns)|-2|-0|An async uses this sleight to increase their natural or augmented sensory perception (sight, audio, smell, augmented) by enhanced cerebral processing, granting a +20 bonus modifier on sensory-based Perception Tests.|||||||
PSI|Superior Kinesics|Chi|Passive|Automatic|Self|Constant||-0|The async acquires more insight into people's emotive signals, gestures, facial expressions, and body language when it comes time to predict the person's emotional state, intent, or reactions. Apply a +10 modifier to Kinesics Skill Tests.|||||||
PSI|Time Sense|Chi|Active|Automatic|Self|Temp (Action Turns)|-1|-0|An async with this ability can slow down his perception of time, making everything appear to move in slow motion or at reduced speed. In game terms, this sleight grants the async a Speed of +1. This extra Action Phase, however, can only be spent on mental and mesh actions.|||||||
PSI|Unconscious Lead|Chi|Active|Automatic|Self|Temp (Action Turns)|-1|-0|This sleight allows the async to override their consciousness and let their unconscious mind take point. While in this state, the async's conscious mind is only dimly aware of what is transgressing, and any memories of this period will be hazy at best. The advantage is that the unconscious mind acts more quickly, and so the async's Speed is boosted by +1. The character remains aware and active, but is incapable of complex communication or other mental actions and is motivated by instinct and primitive urges more than conscious thought. Though it is recommended that the player retain control of their character while using Unconscious Lead, the gamemaster should feel free to direct the character's actions as they see fit.|||||||
||||||||||||||||
PSI|Alienation|Gamma|Active|Complex|Touch|Temp (Action Turns)|0|Psi Assault|Alienation is an offensive sleight that create a sense of disconnection between an ego and its morphsimilar to that experienced when resleeved into a new body. The ego finds their body cumbersome, strange, and alien, almost like they are a prisoner within it. If the async beats the target in an Opposed Test, treat the test as a failed Integration Test for the target. This effect lasts for the sleights duration.|||||||
PSI|Charisma|Gamma|Active|Quick|Touch|Temp (Minutes)|-1|Control|The async uses this sleight to influence the target's mind on a subconscious level, so that the target perceives them to be charming, magnetic, and persuasive. If the async beats the target in an Opposed Test, they gain a +30 modifier on all subsequent Social Skill Tests for the chosen duration.|||||||
PSI|Cloud Memory|Gamma|Active|Complex|Touch|Temp (Minutes)|-1|Control|Cloud Memory allows the async to temporarily disrupt the target's ability to form long-term memories. If the async wins the Opposed Test, the target's memory-saving ability is negated for the duration. The target will retain short-term memories during this time, but will soon forget anything that occurred while this sleight was in effect.|||||||
PSI|Deep Scan|Gamma|Active|Complex|Touch|Sustained|1|Sense|Deep Scan is a more intrusive version of Thought Browse (See Below), made to extract information from the targeted individual. If the Opposed Test succeeds, the async telepathically invades the target's mind and can probe it for information. For every 10 full points of MoS the async achieves on their test, they retrieve one piece of information. Each item takes one full Action Turn to retrieve, during which the sleight must be sustained. The target is aware of this mental probing, though they will not know what information the async acquired.|||||||
PSI|Drive Emotion|Gamma|Active|Complex|Touch|Temp (Action Turns)|-1|Control|This sleight allows the async to stimulate cortical areas of the target's brain related to emotion. This allows the async to induce, amplify, or tone down specific emotions, thereby manipulating the target. If the async beats the target in an Opposed Test, they will act in accordance with the emotion for the duration and under certain circumstances may suffer from certain penalties (up to +/-30), as determined by the gamemaster. For example, an async might receive a +30 Intimidation Test modifier against a target imbued with fear.|||||||
PSI|Ego Sense|Gamma|Active|Complex|Close|Temp (Action Turns)|-1|Sense|Ego Sense can be used to detect the presence and location of other sentient and biological life forms (i.e., egos) within the async's range. To detect these life forms, the async makes a single Sense Test, opposed by each life form within range. The async may suffer a modifier for detecting small animals and insects, similar to the modifier applied for targeting them in ranged combat; likewise, a modifier for detecting larger life forms may also be applied. If successful, the async has detected that the life form is nearby. Every 10 full points of MoS will ascertain another piece of information regarding the detected life: direction from async, approximate size, type of creature, distance from async, etc. The async will know if the target moves, if they do so during the sleight's duration.|||||||
PSI|Emathetic Scan|Gamma|Active|Quick|Close|Sustained|-2|Sense|Empathic Scan enables the async to sense the target's base emotions. If the async wins the Opposed Test, they intuitively feel the target's emotional current state for as long as the sleight is sustained. At the gamemaster's discretion, this knowledge may provide a modifier (up to +30) for certain Social skill tests.|||||||
PSI|Implant Memory|Gamma|Active|Complex|Touch|Instant|0|Control|"An async using this sleight can implant a memory of up to an hour's length inside the target's mind. This memory very obviously does not belong to the target""there is no way they will confuse it for one of their own. The intent is not to fake memories, but to place one of the async's memories in the target's mind so that the target can access it just like any other memory. This can be useful for ""archiving"" important data with an ally, providing a literal alternate perspective, or simply making a ""data dump"" for the target to peruse. Implant Memory requires an Opposed Test against unwilling participants. At the gamemaster's discretion, particularly traumatic memories might inflict mental stress on the recipient."|||||||
PSI|Implant Skill|Gamma|Active|Complex|Touch|Temp (Action Turns)|0|Control|Similar to Implant Memory, this sleight allows the async to impart some of their expertise and implant it into the target's mind. For the duration of the sleight, the target benefits when using that skill. If the async's skill is between 31 and 60, the target receives a +10 bonus. If the async's skill is 61+, the target receives a +20 bonus. Implant Skill requires an Opposed Test against unwilling participants. In some cases, the target has been known to use the skill with the async's flair and mannerisms.|||||||
PSI|Mimic|Gamma|Active|Quick|Close|Instant|0|Sense|"In a setting where changing your body and face is not unusual, people learn to recognize habits and personality quirks more often. The async must use this sleight on a target and succeed in a Success Test. If successful, the async acquires an ""imprint"" of the target's mind that they can take advantage of when impersonating that ego. The async then receives a +30 bonus on Impersonation Tests when mimicking the target's behavior and social cues."|||||||
PSI|Mindlink|Gamma|Active|Quick|Touch|Sustained|1/target past first|Control|"Mindlink allows two-way mental communication with a target. This may be used on more than one target simultaneously, in which case the async can act as a telepathic ""server,"" so that everyone mindlinked with the async may also telepathically communicate with each other (via the async, however, so they overhear). Language is still a factor in mindlinked communications, but this barrier may be overcome by transmitting sounds, images, emotions, and other sensations. Mindlink requires an Opposed Test against unwilling participants."|||||||
PSI|Omni Awareness|Gamma|Active|Quick|Close|Temp (Minutes)|-1|Sense|An async with Omni Awareness is hypersensitive to other biological life that is observing them. During this sleight's duration, the async makes a Sense Test that is opposed by any life that has focused their attention on them within the sleight's range; if successful, the async knows they are being watched, but not by whom or what. It does, however, apply a +30 Perception bonus to spot the observer. This sleight does not register partial attention or fleeting attention, or simple perception of the async, it only notices targets who are actively observing (even if they are concealing their observation). This sleight is effective in spotting a tail, as well as finding potential mates in a bar.|||||||
PSI|Penetration|Gamma|Active|Quick|Touch|Instant|+1/AP (max 10)|Psi Assault|Penetration is a sleight that works in conjunction with any offensive sleight that involves the Psi Assault skill. It allows the async to penetrate the Psi Shield of an opponent by concentrating their psi attack. Every point of Armor Penetration applied to a psi attack inflicts 1 point of strain. The maximum AP that may be applied equals the async's Psi Assault skill divided by 10 (round down).|||||||
PSI|Psi Shield|Gamma|Passive|Automatic|Self|Constant||-0|Psi Shield bolsters the async's mind to psi attack and manipulation. If the async is hit by a psi attack, they receive WIL / 5 (round up) points of armor, reducing the amount of damage inflicted. They also receive a +10 modifier when resisting any other sleights.|||||||
PSI|Psychic Stab|Gamma|Active|Complex|Touch|Instant|0|Psi Assault|Psychic Stab is an offensive sleight that seeks to inflict physical damage on the target's brain and nervous system. Each successful attack inflicts 1d10 + (WIL / 10, round up) damage. Increase the damage by +5 if an Excellent Success is scored.|||||||
PSI|Scramble|Gamma|Passive|Automatic|Self|Constant||-0|Scramble allows the async using the sleight to hide from another async using the Ego Sense or Omni Awareness sleights. Apply a +30 modifier to the defending async's Opposed Test.|||||||
PSI|Sense Block|Gamma|Active|Complex|Touch|Temp (Action Turns)|-1|Psi Assault|Sense Block disables and short circuits one of the target's sensory cortices (chosen by the async), interfering with and possibly negating a specific source of sensory input for the chosen duration. If the async beats the target in the Opposed Test, the target suffers a -30 modifier to Perception Tests with that sense equal (doubled to -60 if the async scores an Excellent Success).|||||||
PSI|Spam|Gamma|Active|Complex|Touch|Temp (Action Turns)|0|Psi Assault|The sleight allows the async to overload and flood one of the target's sensory cortices (chosen by the async), spamming them with confusing and distracting sensory input and thereby impairing them. If the async wins the Opposed Test, the target suffers a -10 modifier to all tests the duration of the sleight (doubled to -20 if the async scores an Excellent Success).|||||||
PSI|Static|Gamma|Active|Complex|Close|Sustained|0|Sense|The async generates an anti-psi jamming field, impeding any use of ranged sleights within their range. All such ranged sleights suffer a -30 modifier. This sleight has no effect on self or touch-range sleights.|||||||
PSI|Subliminal|Gamma|Active|Complex|Touch|Instant|2|Control|"The Subliminal sleight allows the async to influence the train of thought of another person by implementing a single post-hypnotic suggestion into the mind of the target. If the async wins the Opposed Test, the recipient will carry out this suggestion as if it was their own idea. Implanted suggestions must be short and simple; as a rule of thumb, the gamemaster may only accept suggestions encompassed by a short sentence (for example: ""open the airlock,"" or ""hand over the weapon""). At the gamemaster's discretion, the target may receive a bonus for resisting suggestions that are immediately life threatening (""jump off the bridge"") or that violate their motivations or personal strictures.

PSI|Thought Browse|Gamma|Active|Complex|Touch|Sustained|-1|Sense|"Thought Browse is a less-intrusive form of mind reading which scans the target's surface thoughts for certain ""keywords"" like a particular word, phrase, sound, or image chosen by the async. Rather than digging through the target's ego as with the Deep Scan sleight, Thought Browse merely verifies whether a target has a particular person, place, event, or thing in mind, which can be used by a savvy investigator to draw conclusions without the need to invade the mind directly. Thought Browse may be sustained, allowing the async to continue scanning the target's thoughts over time. The async must beat the target in an Opposed Test for each scanned item."|||||||

GEAR|Diamond Ax|Weapon|-3|2d10+3+(SOM/10)|||Blades||||||||Low|Commonly found on many habitats for fire and emergency purposes, axes require two hands to wield. Their blades are diamond-coated for superior cutting ability.
GEAR|Flex Cutter|Weapon|-1|1d10+3+(SOM/10)|||Blades||||||||Low|The blade of this machete-like weapon is made of a memory polymer. When deactivated, the blade is limp and flexible, and may even be rolled up or otherwise easily concealed. When activated, however, the blade stiffens and sharpens into a vicious slashing weapon.
GEAR|Knife|Weapon|-1|1d10+2+(SOM/10)|||Blades||||||||Trivial|A standard cutting implement, still carried by many.
GEAR|Monofilament Sword|Weapon|-4|2d10+2+(SOM/10)|||Blades||||||||Low|Though swords are rather archaic in the time of Eclipse Phase, a few eccentrics take advantage of modern versions with a self-sharpening near-monomolecular edge, easily capable of slicing through metal or limbs.
GEAR|Vibroblade|Weapon|-2|2d10+(SOM/10)|||Blades||||||||Low|These buzzing electronic blades vibrate at a high frequency for extra cutting ability. This has little extra effect when stabbing or slashing, but provides an extra -3 AP and +2d10 damage when carefully sawing through something.
GEAR|Wasp Knife|Weapon|-1|1d10+2+(SOM/10)|||Blades||||||||Low|Wasp knives are equipped with a canister in their handle. The common use is to fill these canisters with pressured air, which inflates inside the target. This is potentially lethal in vacuum or pressurized environments (like underwater), as the gas bursts out of the body cavity to escape (+2d10 damage in such situations). Wasp knives may also be loaded with chemicals, drugs, or nanobots. The target must be damaged for the canister's contents to affect them.
GEAR|Club|Weapon|0|1d10+2+(SOM/10)|||Clubs||||||||Trivial|Clubs encompasses a wide range of one-handed blunt objects, from saps to sticks to pipes.
GEAR|Extendable Baton|Weapon|0|1d10+2+(SOM/10)|||Clubs||||||||Trivial|This hardened composite baton retracts into its handle for easy carrying, storage, or concealment. Extending it simply requires a flick or an electronic signal.
GEAR|Shock Baton|Weapon|0|1d10+2+(SOM/10)+Shock|||Clubs||||||||Low|Shock batons are standard clubs used for policing duties, but when activated they also deliver an electric shock to struck targets.
GEAR|Monowire Garrote|Weapon|-8|3d10|||Exotic Melee Weapons: Monowire Garrote||||||||Moderate|This assassin's weapon features a dangerous monomolecular wire wrapped around a contained spool with two handles. One handle grips the spool, while the other extends the wire so that it may be used to wrap around targets (typically necks or limbs) and slice through them when pulled. Monofilament tensile strength is weak, however, usually breaking after one use.
GEAR|Bioware Claws|Augmentation,Weapon|-1|1d10+1+(SOM/10)|||Unarmed Combat|||||||Biomorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|The morph has retractable claws like those of a cat. These claws do not interfere with the character's manual dexterity and are razor sharp. However, they are relatively small and only do 1d10 + 1 + (SOM / 10) damage, with an AP of -1. As a result, they are legal in almost all habitats and are considered tools as much as weapons.
GEAR|Digging Claws|Augmentation,Weapon|-1|1d10+2+(SOM/10)|||Unarmed Combat|||||||Biomorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|Adapted from the genetics of hole-digging creatures like moles and aardvarks, digging claws are lengthier, sturdier hands with hardy claws for loosening ground, cutting through hard surfaces, and shoveling dirt aside. Despite these changes, digging claws are still capable of grasping and fine manipulation like regular human hands. They can also be wielded offensively with Unarmed Combat skill, inflicting 1d10 + 2 + (SOM / 10) DV with an AP of -1.
GEAR|Cyberclaws|Augmentation,Weapon|-2|1d10+3+(SOM/10)|||Unarmed Combat|||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|The bones on the back of the morph's hand are bonded to smart material claws. These claws can extend through concealed ports in the morph's skin and extend 6 inches past the morph's knuckles. These razor-sharp weapons inflict 1d10 + 3 + (SOM / 10) damage and have an AP of -2. If combined with eelware, they can also inflict electric shocks. Likewise, cyberclaws can also deliver poison or nanotoxins secreted from a poison gland or implanted nanotoxins.
GEAR|Densiplast Gloves|Weapon|0|1d10+2+(SOM/10)|||Unarmed Combat||||||||Trivial|These gloves extra-harden when activated, for extra punch.
GEAR|Eelware|Augmentation,Weapon|0|Shock|||Unarmed Combat|||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|Derived from electric eel genetics, a character can have eelware implanted so that it connects to a network of bioconductors in the hands and feet (or other limbs), allowing the character to generate stunning shocks with a touch. Eelware inflicts shock damage exactly like a pair of shock gloves. Eelware can also be used to power implants and specially designed handheld devices by touch.
GEAR|Shock Gloves|Weapon|0|1d10+(SOM/10)+Shock|||Unarmed Combat||||||||Low|When activated, these gloves deliver an incapacitating shock along with every punch or grab. Note that the effect is the same whether wearing one glove or two.
GEAR|Unarmed|Weapon|0|1d10+(SOM/10)|||Unarmed Combat||||||||None|

GEAR|Armor Clothing|Armor||||||3/4|FALSE|||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Trivial|The extra-resilient organoweave fibers and fullerene materials that offer basic protection against kinetic and energy weapons can be woven in with normal smart materials to create a wide range of discreet armor clothing that provides a subtle level of security. Such protective garments are indistinguishable from regular clothing and come in all styles and designs. Armor clothing provides an Armor Value of 3/4.
GEAR|Bioweave Armor (Light)|Armor,Augmentation||||||2/3|FALSE|||||Biomorph,Uplift,Pod|Low|Bioweave armor involves lacing the morph's skin with artificial spider silk biological fibers. This provides an Armor rating of 2/3 without changing the appearance, texture, or sensitivity of the morph's skin. This armor is cumulative with worn armor.
GEAR|Bioweave Armor (Heavy)|Armor,Augmentation||||||3/4|FALSE|||||Biomorph,Uplift,Pod|Moderate|Heavy bioweave armor involves lacing the morph's skin with a denser and thicker network of the same fibers. The morph's skin becomes thicker and somewhat less flexible except at the joints. The morph's skin also has an unusually smooth look, and a distinctively smooth and tough-feeling texture. This provides an Armor rating of 3/4 without decreasing the morph's mobility. The character's sense of touch, however, is significantly reduced (-20 modifier) except on their hands, feet, and face. This armor is cumulative with worn armor.
GEAR|Carapace Armor|Armor,Augmentation||||||11/11|TRUE|||||Biomorph,Uplift,Pod|Moderate|Carapace armor combines bioweave armor with hard but flexible plates of a chitin-ceramic hybrid material modeled on the microscopic structure and texture of arthropod exoskeletons. This armor is obvious and has a somewhat crocodilian or insectoid appearance (character's choice). The morph is completely hairless as well. This provides an Armor rating of 11/11. This armor is not cumulative with worn armor.
GEAR|Heavy Combat Armor [Frame Replacement]|Armor,Augmentation||||||16/16|FALSE|||||Synthmorph|High|The synthmorph's frame is loaded with armor that offers protection from heavy weapons for serious combat operations. This modification is bulky and noticeable; the bot frame is encased in a heavy-duty carapace. It increases the bot's built-in Armor to 16/16. The shell's mobility systems and power output are also enhanced to deal with the extra load.
GEAR|Industrial Armor [Frame Replacement]|Armor,Augmentation||||||14/12|FALSE|||||Synthmorph|Moderate|The shell is equipped with protection against collisions, extreme weather, industrial accidents, and similar wear-and-tear. Increase the bot's built-in Armor rating to 10/10.
GEAR|Light Combat Armor [Frame Replacement]|Armor,Augmentation||||||10/10|FALSE|||||Synthmorph|Moderate|The synthmorph's frame is protected by armor designed for policing and security duties. This increases the bot's built-in Armor to 14/12.

||||||||||||||||
GEAR|Laser Pulser|Weapon|--|2d10 or 1d10 Stun|SA or SS|50 (100 stun)|Beam Weapons||||||||Moderate|"Laser weapons use focused beams of light to inflict damage on the target by burning into it and causing it's outer surface to vaporize and expand, creating an explosive effect. The laser beam is pulsed in order to bite into the target before the beam is diffused. Pulsers are vulnerable to atmospheric effects like dust, mist, smoke, or rain, however""the gamemaster should reduce their effective range categories as appropriate. Note that laser pulses are invisible in the normal visual spectrum (but are visible to characters with enhanced vision). Pulsers are medium-sized and fire in semi-auto mode. One advantage to the pulser is that it can be placed in less-lethal mode. In this case, it first fires a pulse at the target to create a ball of plasma, quickly fired by a second pulse that strikes the plasma and creates a flash-bang shockwave to stun and disorient the target. This blast has an area of effect with a 1-meter radius. Anyone caught in the blast must make a SOM x 2 Test (SOM x 3 for synthmorphs or biomorphs with any form of pain tolerance). Failure means the target is temporarily stunned and disoriented and loses their next action. A critical failure means the target is knocked down and paralyzed for 1 Action Turn per 10 points of MoF. In this stun setting, the pulser fires only in single-shot mode."
GEAR|Microwave Agonizer|Weapon|-- or -5|Pain (see desc) or 2d10 |SA|50 or 100|Beam Weapons||||||||Moderate|"The agonizer fires millimeter-wave beams that create an unpleasant burning sensation in skin (even through armor) and to metals. Agonizers have two settings. The first is an active denial setting that causes extreme burning pain in the target, inflicting -20 to the target's actions and forcing them to move away from the beam on their next action unless they succeed in a WIL Test (targets with Level 1 Pain Tolerance or the equivalent only suffer a -10 modifier and roll WIL x 2). Synthetic morphs and biomorphs with Level 2 Pain Tolerance (or the equivalent) are immune to this weapon. The second setting (colloquially known as the ""roast"" setting) has the same effect of the first, but also actually burns the target, inflicting the listed damage. Originally developed for crowd control, the agonizer is also useful for repelling animals. The agonizer is small-sized and fires in semi-auto mode."
GEAR|Particle Beam Bolter|Weapon|-2|2d10+4|SA|50|Beam Weapons||||||||High|This weapon shoots a bolt of accelerated particles at near light speed that transfer massive amounts of kinetic energy to the target, superheating and creating an explosion when striking. The bolter's beam is not diffused by the cloud that occurs when it strikes, and so it has greater penetration than the laser pulser. Likewise, the bolter is not affected by smoke, fog, or rain. The bolter's beam is invisible. Note that bolters are designed for either atmospheric or exoatmospheric (vacuum) operation, and will not function in the opposite environment (though bulkier dual models, combining both models, are also available). Bolters fire in semi-auto mode and are rifle-sized two-handed weapons.
GEAR|Plasma Rifle|Weapon|-8|3d10+20|SA|10|Beam Weapons||||||||Expensive|This bulky, heavy, two-handed weapon blasts a stream of nova-hot plasma at the target, inflicting severe burns and thermal damage, possibly melting or evaporating the target entirely. Plasma rifles are perhaps the deadliest man-portable weapons in use. Plasma guns suffer from dangerous overheating in vacuum, however, and so require 1 full Action Turn of cool-down time after every 2 shots. Plasma rifles only fire in semi-auto mode.
GEAR|Stunner|Weapon|--|1d10/2 + shock|SA|200|Beam Weapons||||||||Moderate|The stunner is an electrolaser that creates an electrically-conductive plasma channel to the target, down which it transmits a powerful electric current, shocking the target. Stunners do not work in vacuum. Stunners fire in semi-auto mode.
||||||||||||||||
GEAR|Buzzer|Weapon|--|Nanoswarm|SS|3|Spray Weapons||||||||Moderate|Equipped with a specialized nanobot hive, Buzzers are used to spray a nanoswarm on a target or area. They have a limited capacity of swarms, though the nanohive can construct one new swarm each hour. This weapon is two-handed.
GEAR|Freezer|Weapon|--|Incapacitation|SA|20|Spray Weapons||||||||Moderate|Freezers spew out a fast-hardening foam that immediately begins to harden. They are primarily used as a non-lethal method of immobilizing or securing a target. Struck characters must immediately make a REF x 3 Test or become trapped. Apply a -30 modifier to this test if the attacker scored an Excellent Success (MoS 30+). The foam allows characters to breath even if their mouth and nose are covered, but it may impede sight. Freezer foam can be spiked with contact toxins or drugs to additionally sedate the target. It can also be used to construct temporary barricades or cover. Hardened foam has an Armor of 10 and Durability of 20. It slowly breaks down and degrades over a 12 hour period. Freezers are two-handed.
GEAR|Shard|Weapon|-10|1d10+6|SA,BF,SA|100|Spray Weapons||||||||Low|The shard pistol is a flechette weapon, firing a stream of of diamondoid monomolecular shards at high velocities. These micro flechettes are very good at penetrating armor, but they do not disperse kinetic energy well and so do not cause as much tissue damage as kinetic weapons. Shard ammunition is often coated with drugs or toxins for extra efficiency.
GEAR|Shredder|Weapon|-10|2d10+5|SA,BF,FA|100|Spray Weapons||||||||Moderate|A heavier version of the shard pistol, the shredder fires a larger cloud of lethal flechettes, enough to shred a portion of the target into a fine mist.
GEAR|Sprayer|Weapon|As Chemical/Drug|As a Chemical/Drug|SA|20|Spray Weapons||||||||Low|This is a general-purpose two-handed squirtgun, loaded with tanks filled with the chemical or drug of the wielder's choice.
GEAR|Torch|Weapon|-4|3d10|SS|20|Spray Weapons||||||||Moderate|This modern flamethrower uses condensed ammunition capsules rather than fuel tanks, scorching targets and setting them on fire. Any hit that is an Excellent Success (MoS 30+) sets the target on fire, where they will continue to take 2d10 damage per Action Turn. These chemical fires are particularly difficult to put out unless they are deprived of oxygen. Torches are two-handed.

GEAR|Seeker Rifle (Micromissile/Minimissile)|Weapon|Per Ammo|Per Ammo|SA|12 Micromissile/6 Minimissile|Seeker Weapons||||||||High| The seeker rifle comes in a bullpup configuration and fires either micromissiles or minimissiles in semi-auto mode. It is a two-handed weapons.
GEAR|Underbarrel Seeker (Micromissile)|Weapon|Per Ammo|Per Ammo|SA|6|Seeker Weapons||||||||Moderate| This seeker micromissile launcher is commonly attached to the underbarrel of SMGs or assault rifles. It fires in semi-auto mode.
GEAR|Vortex Ring Gun|Weapon||Payload, if present|--|--|Exotic Ranged Weapon: Vortex Ring Gun||||||||Moderate|"This less-lethal two-handed weapon detonates a blank cartridge and accelerates the explosive pressure down a widening barrel so that it develops into a high-speed vortex ring""a spinning, donut-shaped blast vortex. This concussive blast is used to knock down and incapacitate close-range targets. Struck targets suffer a -10 action modifier for the rest of that Action Turn and must must succeed in a SOM x 2 Test or fall down. If their MoF is 30+, they are additionally stunned and unable to act until the end of the next Action Turn. Drugs, chemicals, and similar agents may be loaded into the charge as well."
||||||||||||||||
GEAR|Cortical Stack|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Moderate|(EP p. 300) A cortical stack is a tiny cyberware data storage unit protected within a synthdiamond case the size of a grape, implanted at the base of the skull where the brain stem and spinal cord connect. It contains a digital backup of that character's ego. Part nanoware, the implant maintains a network of nanobots that monitor synaptic connections and brain architecture, noting any changes and updating the ego backup in real time, right up to the moment of death. If the character dies, the cortical stack can be recovered and they may be restored from the backup. Cortical stacks do not have external or wireless access (for security), they must be surgically removed. Cortical stacks are extremely durable, requiring special effort to damage or destroy. They are commonly recovered from bodies that have otherwise been pulped or mangled. Cortical stacks are intentionally isolated from mesh inserts and other implants, as a security measure to prevent hacking or external tampering.
GEAR|Basic Biomods|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Pod,Uplift|Moderate|(EP p. 300) Almost universal in biomorphs, many habitats will not allow individuals to visit/immigrate if their biomorph does not possess these biomods in order to preserve public health. Basic biomods consists of a series of genetic tweaks, tailored virii, and bacteria that speed healing, greatly increase disease resistance, and impede aging. A morph with basic biomods heals twice as fast as an early 21st century human, gradually regrows lost body parts, is immune to all normal diseases (from cancer to the flu), and is largely immune to aging. In addition, the morph requires no more than 3-4 hours of sleep per night, is immune to ill-effects from long-term exposure to low or zero gravity, and does not naturally suffer from biological problems like depression, shock reactions after being injured, or allergies.
GEAR|Basic Mesh Inserts|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Moderate|(EP p. 300) Mesh inserts are ubiquitous among modern morphs. This network of cybernetic brain implants is essential equipment for anyone who wants to stay connected and make full use of the wireless mesh. The interconnected components of this system include: *Cranial Computer: This computer serves as the hub for the character's personal area network and is home to their muse. It has all of the functions of a smartphone and PDA, acting as a media player, meshbrowser, alarm clock/calendar, positioning and map system, address book, advanced calculator, file storage system, search engine, social networking client, messaging program, and note pad. It manages the user's augmented reality input and can run any software the character desires. It also processes XP data, allowing the user to experience other people's recorded memories, and also allowing the user to share their own XP sensory input with others in real-time. Facial/image recognition and encryption software are included by default. *Radio Transceiver: This transceiver connects the user to the mesh and other characters/devices within range. It has an effective range of 20 kilometers in deep space or other locations far from radio interference and 1 kilometer in crowded habitats. *Medical Sensors: This array of implants monitors the user's medical status, including heart rate, respiration, blood pressure, temperature, neural activity, and much more. A sophisticated medical diagnostic system interprets the data and warns the user of any concerns or dangers. Using any of these functions is as easy as thinking.
GEAR|Cyberbrain|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph,Pod|Moderate|"(EP p. 300) Cybernetic brains are where the ego (or controlling AI) resides in synthmorphs and pods. Modeled on biological brains, cyberbrains have a holistic architecture and serve as the command node and central processing point for sensory input and decision-making. Only one ego or AI may ""inhabit"" a cyberbrain at a time; to accommodate extras, mesh inserts or a ghost-rider module must be used. Since cyberbrains store memories digitally, they have the equivalent of mnemonic augmentation. They also have a built-in puppet sock so that they may be remote-controlled, though this option may be removed by those who value their security. Cyberbrains are vulnerable to brainhacking and other forms of electronic infiltration/attack. Cyberbrains come equipped with two or more pairs of external access jacks, usually located at the base of the skull, which allow for direct wired connections."
GEAR|Direction Sense|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|"(EP p. 301) The character has an innate sense of direction and distance using advanced inertial navigation. The character can arbitrarily define any point as ""north"" and keep track of which direction that is, as well as knowing approximately how far they have come. Characters with this augmentation can always retrace any route they have taken, only experiencing difficulty with three-dimensional routes lacking navigational markers (such as deep space or undersea; apply a -30 modifier). Since positioning inside habitats by anyone with basic mesh inserts is an automatic affair, only characters venturing to remote locations require this augmentation."
GEAR|Echolocation|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 301) The character possesses sonar similar to that of a bat or dolphin. The character bounces brief ultrasonic pulses off their surroundings and uses them to form an image of these surroundings through the pattern of reflections of these pulses received by the character's ears. For more details, see Using Enhanced Senses. This augmentation works in both air and water and has a range of 20 meters in air and 100 meters in water.
GEAR|Enhanced Hearing|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|"(EP p. 301) The morph's ears are enhanced to hear both higher and lower frequency sounds""the range of sounds they can hear is twice that of normal human ears (see Using Enhanced Senses). In addition, their hearing is considerably more sensitive, allowing them to hear sounds as if they were five times closer than they are. A character with this augmentation can easily overhear even a softly spoken conversation at another table in a small restaurant. This augmentation provides a +20 modifier to all Perception Tests involving hearing."
GEAR|Enhanced Smell|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 301) The morph's sense of smell is equal to that of a bloodhound. The user can identify both chemicals and individuals by smell, and can track people and chemically reactive objects by smell as long as the trail was made within the last several hours and has not been obscured. The character can also gain a general sense of the emotions and health of any character within 5 meters (+20 to Perception or Kinesics Tests to do so).
GEAR|Enhanced Vision|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 301) The morph's eyes have tetrachromatic vision capable of exceptional color differentiation. These eyes can also see the electromagnetic spectrum from terahertz wave frequencies to gamma rays, enabling them to see a total of several dozen colors, instead of the seven ordinary human eyes can perceive. In addition, these eyes have a variable focus equivalent to 5 power magnifiers or binoculars. This augmentation provides a +20 modifier to all Perception Tests involving vision. For further applications, see Using Enhances Senses.
GEAR|Lateral Line|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|"(SW p. 166) A transgenic organ developed from aquatic creatures, a lateral line hears low-frequency sounds and can detect movement and vibrations through nearby liquids. Suryas use lateral lines to ""hear"" in the corona's plasma atmosphere."
GEAR|Polarization Vision|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(PO p. 148) Characters capable of seeing polarized light can view an aspect of light most humans only see weakly. Polarization reveals visual characteristics much in the way that color does for normal vision: it enhances contrast, foils camouflage, and helps to detect patterns and objects, particularly in light that is reflected off a shiny surface or scattered through the atmosphere or water. One major use of polarization is easier orien-tation in relation to polarized light sources (such as navigating underwater by the direction of sunlight). It also allows better detection of water surfaces, reflec-tive surfaces, and certain patterns made in the water or on skin (which can be created by chameleon skin). Polarization vision can discriminate watery surfaces from mirages and better detect transparent objects. In game terms, polarization vision allows the character to ignore negative visual Perception modifiers for camouflage, transparency, or viewing underwater. At the game-master's discretion, it may provide a bonus modifier for Perception Tests to detect patterns and Navigation Tests where orientation to light sources is beneficial. Octomorphs have natural polarization vision by default.
#GEAR|Scent Affinity|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Trivial|This modification may only be applied to smart animals. This particular animal has been modified to identify and trust a particular scent or pheromonal signature. Anyone giving off this particular olfactory signature receives a +30 modifier to Animal Handling Tests against this creature, assuming the critter can smell them. Trainers, smart animal handlers, and wealthy owners use this bioware to maintain better control over their pets/investments.
GEAR|Ultraviolet Vision|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Trivial|(PO p. 148) This is a minor enhancement, simply adding perception of ultraviolet frequencies to the character's visual capabilities. Neo-avians have natural ultraviolet vision by default.
GEAR|Eidetic Memory|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift,Eidolon|Low|(EP p. 301) The character can remember everything that ever happened to them, in detail, with no long term memory loss. For example, they can recite a page they read in a book a month ago, recall a string of 200 random characters they viewed a year ago, or even tell you what they had for breakfast on a particular date a decade ago. However, they can only remember things they paid attention to. The character will not remember the contents of a note on someone's desk if they merely glanced at it; they must specifically have read it. No effort is required to use this augmentation, the character merely needs to attempt to remember a specific fact.
GEAR|Hyper Linguist|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift,Eidolon|Low|(EP p. 301) The morph's brain maintains the linguistic flexibility of a small child, allowing the character to learn languages with great ease. This functions as the Hyper Linguist trait.
GEAR|Math Boost|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift,Eidolon|Low|(EP p. 301) This implants functions as the Math Wiz trait.
GEAR|Multiple Personalities|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|High|(EP p. 301) The character's brain is intentionally partitioned to accommodate an extra personality. This multiplicity is not viewed as a disorder, but as a cognitive tool to help people deal with their hypercomplex environments. This extra personality can be an NPC run by the gamemaster, a separate character (in ego form only) made by the player, or the downloaded fork of another character. For all intents and purposes, the extra personality is treated as a separate ego (i.e., it may fork separately), except that both personalities are backed up in the same cortical stack and if downloaded they must be placed in separate morphs or in another morph with this implant. Only one ego may be in control of the morph at a time. The other resides in the background, still active, but not on a surface level. Each ego is completely aware of what the other is doing, thinking, etc. If for some reason the subsumed personality wants to come to the fore, but the other personality won't relinquish control, make an Opposed WIL x 3 Test. Each ego has its own Lucidity and Trauma Threshold, and they track stress and trauma separately. Any psi attacks or social/mental influences only affect the personality at the fore. Having an extra ego in your head, working in the background, is helpful for multitasking. The character receives an extra Complex Action each turn that may only be used for mental or mesh actions.
GEAR|Adrenal Boost|Augmentation||||||||||10:REF||Biomorph,Pod,Uplift|High|(EP p. 302) This adrenal gland enhancement supercharges the character's adrenal response to situations that invoke stress, pain, or strong emotions (fear, anger, lust, hate). When activated, the concentrated burst of norepinephrine accelerates heart rate and blood flow and burns carbohydrates. In game terms, this allows the character to ignore the -10 modifier from 1 wound and temporarily increases REF by +10 (also boosting REF-linked skills and Initiative). These modifiers apply until the character has calmed down (if the character also has endocrine control, then adrenal boosts can be activated and deactivated at will, and the negated wounds are cumulative).
GEAR|Chameleon Skin|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 303) The morph's skin is augmented with complex chromatophores so that it changes color like the skin of a chameleon or an octopus. The morph can match the appearance of almost any color and most patterns. This provides a +20 modifier to Infiltration Tests to avoid being seen or noticed, as long as the character is stationary or not moving faster than a slow walk. The character must also be nude or wearing smart clothing or a chameleon cloak of the same color and pattern. If incompletely camouflaged, or if moving faster, reduce the modifier to +10. In addition to blending in, the character can also consciously change the color and pattern of their skin to deliberately stand out (+20 on Perception Tests to notice) or simply to produce attractive or interesting colors or patterns.
GEAR|Circadian Regulation|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Pod,Uplift|Moderate|(EP p. 304) The morph only requires 2 hours of sleep to maintain health and function at peak mental capacity. The character dreams constantly while asleep and can both fall asleep and wake up almost instantly. In addition, the character can easily and with no ill-effects shift to a 2-day cycle, where they are awake for 44 hours and sleep for 4.
GEAR|Clean Metabolism|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Pod,Uplift|Moderate|"(EP p. 304) The morph's symbiotic bacteria, gut flora, and glands have been genetically engineered to keep the morph ""clean."" The morph also produces smart antibiotics that prevent the growth of any bacteria or yeasts in it or on its skin. As a result, the morph is completely immune to infections, dental cavities, and bad breath, its sweat has no scent, and the morph's efficient digestion produces somewhat less solid waste and less odorous chemicals."
#GEAR|Drug Gland (Low-cost Drug)|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Moderate|The morph has specially-tailored glands designed to produce specific hormones or chemicals and release them in the body. The character has control over these glands and can release the chemicals at will. Each type of drug gland is considered a separate enhancement. [One Category Higher Than Drug]
#GEAR|Drug Gland (Moderate-cost Drug)|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|High|The morph has specially-tailored glands designed to produce specific hormones or chemicals and release them in the body. The character has control over these glands and can release the chemicals at will. Each type of drug gland is considered a separate enhancement. [One Category Higher Than Drug]
#GEAR|Drug Gland (High-cost Drug)|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Expensive|The morph has specially-tailored glands designed to produce specific hormones or chemicals and release them in the body. The character has control over these glands and can release the chemicals at will. Each type of drug gland is considered a separate enhancement. [One Category Higher Than Drug]
GEAR|Emotional Dampers|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 304) This low-cost alternative to endocrine control allows the user to voluntarily damp their morph's emotional responses and various non-verbal cues like pupil dilation, eye movement, or vocal tone. Using this augmentation allows the user to lie and conceal their emotions in such as way as to fool the keenest observer; apply a +30 modifier to Deception and Impersonation Tests. This modification does not affect methods of detecting lies and emotions that involve reading the character's neural state, including psi-gamma sleights. However, this augmentation damps out all emotional responses and so causes the character to be less persuasive in real-time personal interactions, imposing a -10 modifier to other Social skill tests like Persuasion. Characters can turn this augmentation on or off at will.
GEAR|Endocrine Control|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Pod,Uplift,Eidolon|High|(EP p. 304) This augmentation modifies the morph's endocrine system, giving the character fine control over their hormone output. This allows the character to completely control their appetite and emotions and to regulate pain. They receive a +30 modifier against the effects of hunger, fear, and any forms of emotional manipulation, such as the Drive Emotion sleight. This augmentation also allows character to lie with perfect conviction and to completely fool all methods of lie detection that do not rely on the target's neural output; apply a +20 modifier to Deception Tests. It also allows the character to remain awake for 48 hours without penalty, but after this time the character begins experiencing normal fatigue. Finally, the ability to regulate pain reception allows the character to ignore the -10 modifier from 1 wound.
GEAR|Enhanced Pheromones|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 305) The morph's biochemistry has been altered so that it produces enhanced pheromonal signals that subconsciously affect the behavior of other humans in the vicinity. These pheromones make the character more attractive and trustworthy to the target; apply a +10 modifier to appropriate Social skill tests, such as Persuasion. This augmentation only affects characters who can smell the pheromones, and it does not affect uplifts or xenomorphs.
GEAR|Enhanced Respiration|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|By boosting both lung efficiency and the blood's oxygen-carrying capacity, the character can live comfortably in both high and low pressure environments, from 0.2 atmospheres to 5 atmospheres, with no dizziness or need for gradual decompression. In addition, the character can hold their breath for up to 30 minutes when performing minimal activity or for up to 10 minutes while performing highly strenuous activity.
GEAR|Gills|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 305) The morph's lung tissue has been adapted to function as gills, allowing the morph to breathe both air and water, as long as the water is not toxic or too stagnant. Characters with this augmentation breathe in water and then expel the water through slits just underneath their lowest pair of ribs that seal when the character is not underwater.
GEAR|Grip Pads|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 305) The morph possesses specialized pads on its palms, lower arms, shins, and the bottoms of its feet. Designed to emulate the pads on gecko feet, characters can support themselves on a wall or ceiling by placing any two of these pads against any surface not made from a material specially designed to resist this augmentation. Characters can climb any surface and move easily across ceilings that can support their weight. Apply a +30 modifier to Climbing Tests. The pads must be free to touch the surface the character is climbing (no gloves). The nature of these pads is obvious to anyone looking at them, but they do not impair the character's sense of touch or manual dexterity. If combined with the vacuum sealing augmentation, the character can even stick to surfaces in the vacuum of space.
GEAR|Hibernation|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 305) The character can voluntarily reduce the morph's metabolism to the point that the morph requires only 5% of the normal amount of food, water, and air. The character appears to sink into a deep sleep, but can maintain a dim awareness of both touch and sound and so can be easily awakened. Entering or leaving this state requires 3 minutes where the character is relatively helpless. With sufficient air, characters can safely hibernate for up to 40 days without food or water.
GEAR|Muscle Augmentation|Augmentation||||||||||5:SOM||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|High|(EP p. 305) The morph's muscle mass has been enhanced and toned and myofibers strengthened. Apply a +5 modifier to SOM. (included)
GEAR|Neurachem (Level 1)|Augmentation|||||||||1|||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|High|(EP p. 305) This bioware modification enhances the character's chemical synapses and juices their neurotransmitters, drastically speeding up neural connections. Neurachem can be mentally activated or triggered by charged emotions. Level 1 neurachem increases the character's Speed stat by +1, with no side effect.
GEAR|Neurachem (Level 2)|Augmentation|||||||||2|||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Expensive|(EP p. 305) This bioware modification enhances the character's chemical synapses and juices their neurotransmitters, drastically speeding up neural connections. Neurachem can be mentally activated or triggered by charged emotions. Level 2 raises the Speed stat by +2, but each time it is used the character suffers a nervous system fatigue hangover for 1 hour after the boost wears off (apply a -20 modifier to all actions).
#GEAR|Poison Gland|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|Similar to the drug gland, this morph has special glands that produce poisons, like the venom glands of a snake. The morph has poison glands in its fingers and mouth, so that it can deliver either poison by scratching someone with a fingernail, biting them hard enough to draw blood, or even by sharing a beverage with someone or spitting into their drink. The morph is immune to the poisons it produces. These glands may not produce nanotoxins.
GEAR|Prehensile Feet|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 305) The morph's feet and leg joints are altered so that its toes are longer and more dexterous and the big toe is transformed into an opposable thumb. Physically, the morph's feet resemble a longer narrower hand or a human foot with finger (and thumb)-like toes. The character can walk normally but must wear specially designed shoes. However, this morph runs somewhat slower than a morph with unmodified feet (-1 meter per Action Turn). In addition, the morph's hips are slightly modified to allow greater mobility. In a properly constructed chair, or when floating in zero-G, the character can use both their hands and their feet to manipulate the same object. Most morphs used by characters who live in zero-G possess this augmentation.
GEAR|Prehensile Tail|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 305) A long (1.5 meters) prehensile tail is added to the morph's backside, extending out from the tailbone. This tail is prehensile and may be used to grab, hold, and even manipulate objects. The character can control the tail's movements with concentration, but it otherwise tends to move on its own. The tail also improves the character's balance; apply a +10 to any Physical skill tests where balance is a factor.
GEAR|Sex Switch|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Pod,Uplift|Moderate|(EP p. 305) A complex suite of alterations allows the character to switch their physical sex to male, female, hermaphrodite, or neuter. This change is mentally triggered but takes approximately 1 week to complete.
GEAR|Skin Pocket|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Pod,Uplift|Trivial|(EP p. 305) The morph has a pocket within its skin layer, capable of holding and providing concealment (+30) for small items.
#GEAR|Temperature Tolerance|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|The morph's temperature regulation and circulation are both substantially enhanced allowing the character to survive in temperatures as low as -30 degrees Celsius and as high as 60 degrees Celsius without discomfort or ill effects.
GEAR|Toxin Filters|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Pod,Uplift|Moderate|(EP p. 305) The morph gains an improved liver and kidneys and biological filters in its lungs. Characters with this augmentation are immune to all chemical and biological toxins, including everything from recreational chemicals to nerve agents to spoiled food. In addition, the character can safely and comfortably breathe smoke and drink salt water. Unlike medichines, toxin immunity prevents the character from experiencing even brief harm or discomfort from a toxin (medichines merely rapidly repair damage caused by the toxin and then remove it from the morph). This augmentation provides no resistance to concentrated acid, nanotechnological attacks, or similar destructive agents. Some characters with this augmentation learn to enjoy the taste of various chemical toxins like cyanide or arsenic.
GEAR|Vacuum Sealing|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Pod,Uplift|High|(EP p. 306) To possess this augmentation, the character must also possess some form of bioware armor or carapace armor. The morph has been specially designed to survive the effects of vacuum. The character's skin resists vacuum as well as protecting the wearer from temperatures from -75 to 100 C. In addition, the character's mouth, nose, and other orifices can seal suf ciently well to resist vacuum, and the morph possesses a special membrane that extends over their eyes, allowing the character to see in vacuum without risking any eye damage. This augmentation is usually combined with either the enhanced respiration or oxygen storage augmentation, or both together.
GEAR|Gliding Membrane|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(SW p. 166) Gliding membranes are thin, muscular sheets that stretch from wrist to ankle, that allow the character to glide through the air. For human-sized morphs in standard Earth or Venusian gravity (1 g), these gliding membranes allow the glider to maintain a glide ratio of 10:1, so it can glide 10 meters for every meter of altitude it loses. In low-gravity environments, this ratio doubles to 20:1 or more. Gliding membranes provide a +10 modifier to Freefall Tests made to cross long distances. Gliding membranes can also be used to ride thermal updrafts, allowing the morph to ascend to higher altitudes. Use the Flight skill to make tests when using gliding membranes. Gliding membranes can be wrapped around the morph's arms, legs, and torso when not being used, allowing the morph to move and wear clothes normally when not gliding.
GEAR|Low Pressure Tolerance|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(SW p. 166) The morph can tolerate extremely low atmospheric pres-sures, such as those found at high altitudes on Mars, with no ill effects. Morphs with this mod are also somewhat more resistant to vacuum exposure and are able to spend up to five minutes in hard vacuum without incurring damage. However, morphs without respirocytes or an oxygen reserve still suffer asphyxiation.
#GEAR|Temperature Tolerance (Improved Cold)|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Pod,Uplift|Moderate|The morph is treated as having the Temperature Tolerance biomod, but with an even greater resistance to low temperatures. The morph can tolerate temperatures as low as -80 C without ill effects.
GEAR|Wings|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Pod,Uplift|Moderate|(SW p. 166) Wings enable the morph to fly at Earth/Venusian grav-ities if small (child-sized) and light, or at low gravities if human-sized or larger. Tests made while flying use the Flight skill. Most wing designs are transgenic and based on bat-wing physiology, so they may be easily folded when not in use. Though the Movement Rate depends on the morph in question and the particular design, a standard Movement Rate is 8/40.Neo-avians have wings by default, as part of their physiology.
#GEAR|Enhanced Respiration (Planet-Specific)|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|The Enhanced Respiration bioware is partly what allows rusters to breathe the atmosphere of Mars. There are many exoplanets with atmospheres that are not breathable by normal transhumans, but that are close enough that they would be with a bit of modification. On some of these planets, rusters with standard enhanced respiration could breathe the air, but on others a different version of this biomod, specific to the atmosphere in question, may be called for.
#GEAR|High-G Augmentation|Augmentation||||||||5||5:SOM||Biomorph,Pod,Uplift|Moderate|This augmentation is specifically designed to allow a morph to operate in environments where gravity is significantly greater than Earth's. The morph's heart and circulatory system are strengthened and its skeleton altered in composition and proportion to be harder, slightly thicker, and considerably more durable. The morph's muscle density is also increased and tendons and ligaments bolstered for improved efficiency in higher gravity. Apply a +5 Durability and +5 SOM bonus. In addition, the character suffers no negative modifiers from gravities up to 2 g, and reduces all penalties for higher gravities by 1g. (DUR and SOM included).
GEAR|Swim Bladder|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(GC p. 154) This transgenic organ is a series of gas-filled sacs that allow the character to control their buoyancy underwater. This bladder is also linked to the inner ear, enabling the character to accurately gauge water pressure/depth and also improving their hearing underwater (+10 to hearing based Perception underwater).
GEAR|Reflex Booster|Augmentation|||||||||1|10:REF||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Moderate|(EP p. 308) The morph's spinal column and nervous system is rewired with superconducting materials, boosting transmission speed. This raises the character's REF by +10 and improves Speed by +1.

GEAR|Anti-Glare|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 306) This visual mod eliminates penalties for glare.
GEAR|Electrical Sense|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 306) The character can sense electric fields. Within 5 meters, the character can instantly tell if an electrical device is on or off and can see the precise location of electrical wiring behind a wall or inside a device. This sense gives the character a +10 modifier on any test involving analyzing, repairing, or modifying electrical equipment.
GEAR|Radiation sense|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 306) The character can sense the presence and approximate source of all forms of dangerous radiation, including neutrons, charged particles, and cosmic rays.
GEAR|T-Ray Emitter|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 306) Mounted under the skin of the user's forehead, this implant generates low-powered beams of terahertz radiation (T-rays) that allow the character to see using reflected T-rays. As discussed in Using Enhanced Senses, this implant combined with the enhanced vision enhancement (or a terahertz sensor) allows the user to effectively see through cloth, plastic, wood, masonry, composites, and ceramics as well as being able to determine the composition of various materials. This implant allows the user to see using reflected T-rays for 20 meters in a normal atmosphere and for 100 meters in vacuum.
#GEAR|Sense Filter|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low| This implant enables a character with a biological hyperspectral enhanced sense (enhanced hearing, smell, or vision) to filter out certain wavelengths and inputs like an equivalent technological sensor device. Normally a person with enhanced vision would experience terahertz, infrared, standard visual, ultraviolet, and gamma ray frequencies all at once. With this implant, however, they can tune out some wavelengths, ignoring them while still seeing the others. The same effect applies to audio or olfactory input, and the filter also allows the user to isolate specific noises or smells, canceling out sensory clutter or focusing on a specific source. This implant must be acquired separately for each sense.
GEAR|Access Jacks|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|"(EP p. 306) Usually located in the base of the skull or neck, this implant is an external socket with a direct neural interface. It allows the character to establish a direct wired connection using a fiber optic cable to external devices or other characters, which can be useful in places where wireless links are unreliable or complete privacy is required. Two characters linked via access jack can ""speak"" mind-to-mind and transfer information between their mesh inserts and other implants. All synthmorphs have these by default."
GEAR|Dead Switch|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 306) This cortical stack accessory is designed to keep the stack from falling into the wrong hands. If the morph is killed, the dead switch wipes and melts the cortical stack completely, so that the ego cannot be recovered. This option is generally only used by covert operatives with recent backups.
GEAR|Emergency Farcaster|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Expensive|(EP p. 306) Only characters with cortical stacks can possess this augmentation. The morph has an implanted quantum farcaster linked to a highly secure storage facility. The high cost of this implant also covers the cost of this storage. Using standard radio and quantum encryption, the farcaster broadcasts full backups of the character's ego (pulled from the cortical stack) once every 48 hours. At the gamemaster's discretion, the backup interval may be scheduled more or less frequently, keeping in mind that ego broadcasts are generally limited for security purposes and because they hog bandwidth. These broadcasts only work when the character is in radio contact with the storage facility and is typically only used inside a habitat to broadcast backups back to a nearby space ship. If the radio broadcasts are blocked or jammed, this device cannot make backups. In the event of a farcaster failure, this augmentation also includes a single-use emergency neutrino broadcaster as well. This broadcaster contains approximately 10 nanograms of antimatter stored in an orange-sized triply-redundant magnetic containment vessel. If the character is dying or urgently wishes to depart the morph, this tiny amount of antimatter is brought into contact with a similarly tiny amount of matter in a controlled fashion that generates a single brief and carefully coded neutrino pulse of the ego's most recent backup. However, the heat generated by this process literally cooks the entire morph, killing it and destroying all implants and electronics in or on it. This entire process takes less than 0.1 second and the broadcast can be received as long as the neutrino receiver is within 100 astronomical units of the character. Within the solar system, this implant effectively guarantees the character's backup. It is less useful on exoplanets where the character is out of neutrino range of their backup facility. The amount of antimatter carried by this implant is sufficiently small enough that it does not produce an explosion and will not damage any surrounding objects. Most habitats carefully scan all visitors to determine if they have this implant and if the amounts of antimatter involved are sufficiently low as not to pose a danger to the habitat and its inhabitants, and some ban this implant entirely.
GEAR|Ghostrider Module|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 307) This implant allows the character to carry another infomorph inside their head. This infomorph could be another muse, an AI, a backed-up ego, or a fork. The module is linked to the character's mesh inserts, so the ghost-rider can access the mesh. The character may limit the ghost-rider's access, or may allow them direct access to their sensory information, thoughts, communications, and other implants.
GEAR|Mnemonic Augmentation|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 307) A character with this augmentation and a cortical stack can access digital recordings of all of the sensory data they have experienced in XP format (and they may share these recordings with others). Mnemonic augmentation differs from the eidetic memory bioware because it allows characters to digitally share all of their sensory data with others. It also allows them to closely examine sensory data they did not initially look at. For example, If the character glanced at a note but did not read it, they can later use image enhancement software to enhance this image and in most cases actually read what the note said. Mnemonic augmentation allows the character to clearly hear all background noises, like a conversation at a nearby table that the character only initially heard a few words of. Using mnemonic augmentation to retrieve a specific piece of information is quite easy, but usually requires between 2 and 20 minutes of concentration.
GEAR|Multitasking|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|High|(EP p. 307) Only characters with cortical stacks can possess this augmentation. The character has an advanced computer installed in their brain that uses the data in the cortical stack to create several simultaneous short-term forks to handle various mental tasks. By design, this computer automatically reintegrates all of these forks into the character's core personality after a maximum of 4 hours, earlier if desired. This augmentation allows the character to both plan a speech and engage in intensive mesh-browsing while simultaneously fighting a gun battle or running from pursuit, since each of the forks operates independently. However, these forks can only perform purely mental or on-line interactions. This augmentation can produce a maximum of two forks at a time, giving the character an extra two Complex Actions on every Action Phase for mental or on-line actions. This implant cannot be used simultaneously with any other augmentation that allows for extra actions, or with the mental speed augmentation.
GEAR|Puppet Sock|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Moderate|"(EP p. 307) This implanted computer allows the biomorph's body (the ""puppet"") to be controlled by another character (the ""puppeteer""). While active, the puppet has no control over their body and is simply along for the ride (at the gamemaster's discretion, puppets who are tormented by repeated or extensive loss of control may suffer mental stress). The puppeteer may directly ""jam"" the puppet or remote control it in the same way that robots and pods are teleoperated. The puppeteer must either be ghost-riding the puppet (see the Ghostrider Module) or have a direct communications link (via mesh, radio, laser, etc.)."
#GEAR|Cybercortex|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low| Similar but less sophisticated than a cyberbrain, a cybercortex is a limited artificial version of the neo-cortex for smart animals. A cybercortex is not sufficient to raise an animal to sapience, but it does boost the animal's ability to learn, comprehend instructions/commands, and reason. Apply a +10 modifier to Animal Handling Tests with this animal. The cyber-cortex also overrides many instinctive behaviors that would be undesirable in a service animal.
GEAR|Life Recorder|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(PO p. 149) Not everyone wants to broadcast their lifelog, whether for public viewing or for private storage elsewhere on the mesh. Some people want to retain a lifelog, but prefer to avoid possible interception of the contents online. Certain security, spy, political, and diplomatic professions may mandate this. Others may commonly find themselves in situations where they are cut off from regular mesh access (such as gatecrashers or remote asteroid herders). Most people also don't want to be bothered with carrying a storage device on their person at all time. In these cases, a life recorder serves the purpose. The life recorder is a micro-sized memory diamond storage device, typically implanted in the head (though occasionally elsewhere in the body). This implant records all sensory input as experienced by the brain to which it is linked. Life recorders are designed as one-way information receivers, simply storing data until they are removed; they are not meant to be accessed, much like cortical stacks.
GEAR|Memory Lock|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift,Eidolon|Low|(PO p. 149) This implant, when activated, prevents information from being stored in the subject's long-term memory or from being recorded via lifelog, mnemonic augmentation, or other sensory link. It also temporarily blocks up-to-the second cortical stack backups. The individual will retain short-term memories, but for no more than a few minutes. This implant is usually a requirement for personal aides, consultants, and other underlings of powerful people. The implants can be remotely activated by the superior during confidential meetings or other secret affairs to ensure privacy and deniability. This implant is also a popular option among some personal couriers who intentionally retain no memories of the party that hired them in case they are intercepted.
GEAR|Cyberlimb|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Moderate|(EP p. 307) In an age when arms and legs can easily be regrown, many people consider cybernetic prostheses to be vulgar and distasteful. The Scum and others, however, treat them as iconic symbols of self-expression. Standard replacement cyberlimbs function the same as their biological equivalents, though that particular limb receives a +3/+3 Armor bonus when targeted specifically (this bonus does not apply to synthmorphs). Cyberlimbs may be masked to look real (see Synthetic Mask), and may also feature small compartments for hiding/storing small objects.
GEAR|Cyberlimb Plus (First limb)|Augmentation||||||||||5:SOM||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|High|"(EP p. 308) More extravagant cyberlimb models are also available, though they require more severe body alteration to accommodate. These limbs apply a +5 SOM bonus per limb (maximum +10). They may be replacement limbs or ""extra"" limbs anchored in the body's skeletal frame. These cyberlimbs may not be masked."
GEAR|Cyberlimb Plus (Second limb)|Augmentation||||||||||5:SOM||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|High|"(EP p. 308) More extravagant cyberlimb models are also available, though they require more severe body alteration to accommodate.

GEAR|Cyberlimb Plus (Additional limb)|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|High|"(EP p. 308) More extravagant cyberlimb models are also available, though they require more severe body alteration to accommodate.

GEAR|Hand Laser|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Moderate|(EP p. 308) The morph has a weapon-grade laser implanted in its forearm, with a flexible waveguide leading to a lens located between the first two knuckles on the morph's dominant hand. The laser fires from this waveguide, inflicting 2d10 damage with 0 AP. The laser is powered by a small nuclear battery located in the morph's torso, good for 50 shots before it must be recharged like other beam weapon batteries.
GEAR|Hardened Skeleton|Augmentation||||||||5||5:SOM||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|High|(EP p. 308) The morph's skeleton has been laced with strengthening materials. Apply a +5 DUR and +5 SOM bonus.
GEAR|Oxygen Reserve|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 308) The morph has a miniature oxygen tank and rebreather installed in its torso. This implant provides the equivalent of the life support system in a light vacsuit, allowing the character to breathe comfortably for up to 3 hours. It feeds oxygen directly to the morph's blood stream, avoiding problems with pressure changes. Implanted sensors automatically cause the character to use the stored oxygen if they detect poisonous or insufficient atmosphere. Without vacuum sealing, the character can only survive in vacuum for 5 minutes, but remains conscious and active for the entire time, giving them far more time to find shelter or a vacsuit than characters without this implant. For every hour the character is in a breathable atmosphere, this implant recovers one hour of oxygen storage. The implant can be fully recharged within 15 minutes if the character is in a high-pressure mostly oxygen atmosphere.
GEAR|Gas Jet System|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Moderate|(SW p. 166) This cybernetic system implants nozzles in the morph's chest, back, and limbs, allowing it to maneuver in microgravity using vectored bursts of gas. It either inputs atmospheric gases through implanted intakes or draws gas from an oxygen reserve implant. This mod applies a +10 modifier to Freefall Tests.
#GEAR|Implant Masking|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Increase the masked implant's cost by one category| Implant masking is not a separate implant, but a modification to an existing one. Masked cybernetic implants are composed of electromagnetic- and acoustic-absorbent smart materials that are less likely to be detected by surveillance and security systems using radar, x-rays, or ultrasound. Apply a -30 modifier to any attempts to detect the implant.
#GEAR|Implanted Nanotoxins|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Moderate|The morph has an implanted nanobot hive that produces nanotoxins. This implant is designed so that the character can deploy these nanobots instantly via a scratch with claws, spraying with saliva, or simply making continuous bare-skin contact. Characters can choose whether or not to deploy these nanobots. Each nanotoxin generator only produces a single variety of nanobots, with the most common types being ones designed to kill or incapacitate almost any living target or ones designed to destroy delicate machinery. Characters are immune to their own nanotoxins. Nanotoxins are highly restricted and many habitats will not allow anyone with this implant on board.
GEAR|Medichines|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 308) This is the most common form of nanoware. These nanobots monitor the user's body at a cellular level and fix any problems that arise. Medichines eliminate most diseases, drugs, and toxins (but not nanodrugs or nanotoxins) before they can do more than minor harm to the host (see Drug Effects). If desired, the user can temporarily override this protection to permit intoxication or other effects, but unless the character activates a second specially labeled override, medichines prevent the toxins from accumulating to lethal or permanently harmful levels. In this case, they can also be activated at a later point to reduce a drug or toxin's remaining duration by half. Medichines allow the character to ignore the effects of 1 wound. They also speed normal healing as noted under Biomorph Healing. If the user suffers 5 or more wounds at once, or more than 6 wounds in an hour, the damage has exceeded the medichines' ability to repair. In this case, the medichines place the character into a medical stasis, where their mind and body are perfectly preserved, but where the character cannot act in any way. Under these circumstances the medichines also send out a priority call for emergency services via the character's mesh inserts. Medichines for synthmorphs and bots consist of nanobots that monitor and repair the shell's integrity and internal system functions. Note that the synthmorph version of medichines allows the synthmorph to self-repair in the same manner by which a biomorph with medichines would naturally heal.
GEAR|Mental Speed|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift,Eidolon|High|(EP p. 308) With this nanoware system, nanobots alter the character's neural architecture and augment the functioning of their neurons. The character can deliberately speed up their mind to think and also receive and process sensory information far faster than ordinary humans. Time seems to subjectively slow down for the character, allowing them to carefully plan their next action, even if they only have a split second to do so. With this system active, the character can discern things occurring too fast for a normal human to perceive, such as the individual frames of an old analog film or understanding sounds that were accelerated to many times their normal speed. The character can also read 10 times faster than normal and can track the paths of bullets and similar fast-moving objects with a successful Perception Test. When using this augmentation, the character gains two extra Complex Actions during each Action Phase that may only be used for mental actions. The character also receives a +30 Initiative bonus. The character thinks at normal speed whenever this nanoware is inactive. This nanoware is incompatible with any other augmentation that provides any form of extra actions, such as multi-tasking. This augmentation can be used as often as desired, but actively using it renders ordinary conversation and social interactions difficult and requires concentration to maintain.
GEAR|Nanophage|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Moderate|(EP p. 309) These nanobots patrol the body, alert for signs of intrusive nanodrugs or -toxins and destroying them before they have more than a minor effect. Nanophages provide automatic immunity against nanodrugs and nanotoxins unless they are specifically commanded to stand down by the user, via their mesh implants.
GEAR|Oracles|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift,Eidolon|Moderate|(EP p. 309) These neural macrosensing nanobots pay attention to the sensory input on which the character is not focusing, alerting them about important things they might otherwise overlook. Oracles also act as a sort of memory buffer and search aid, extending short term memory, helping the character recall memories and details, and crosschecking them with other memories. Oracles negate Perception modifiers for distraction, apply a +10 modifier to Investigation Tests, and add a +30 bonus to memory-related tests.
GEAR|Respirocytes|Augmentation||||||||5||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Moderate|(EP p. 309) These nanobots act as highly-efficient artificial red blood cells, increasing the ability to transfer oxygen and carbon dioxide. This increases the morph's ability to hold their breath to 4 hours and increases DUR by +5.
GEAR|Skillware|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift,Eidolon|High|(EP p. 309) The morph's brain is laced with a network of artificial neurons that may be formatted with downloaded information. This allows the user to download skillsofts into their brains, gaining the use of those programmed skills until the skillsoft is erased or replaced. Skillware systems are only capable of handling 100 total skill points worth of skillsofts at a time.
GEAR|Skinflex|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Moderate|(EP p. 309) This disguise implant allows the user to restructure their facial features and musculature and alter skin tone and hair color. The entire process takes a mere 20 minutes. Skinflex adds +30 to Disguise Tests.
GEAR|Skinlink|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Moderate|(EP p. 309) Skinlink nanobots live on the morph's external skin or shell, automatically swarming over and creating a physical connection with any electronics the user touches. They also take advantage of the electrical field in a biomorph's skin for communication. They allow the user to communicate and mesh with any devices merely by touching them. This is considered a wired link, and so is not subject to wireless interception or interference. Two skinlinked characters can also communicate and mesh simply by touching.
GEAR|Wrist-Mounted Tools|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Moderate|(EP p. 309) The morph has a 6 centimeter-wide metal band containing nanobot generators implanted around each wrist. These nanobots link together to duplicate the function of a utilitool, creating narrow, highly flexible arms that each ends in a specialized tool. These nanobots can also produce tiny fiber optics to allow the character to see through small openings, as well as being able to create small weapons equal to bioware claws. The fact that these tool are mentally controlled gives the character a +20 modifier to skills involving repairing or modifying devices with mechanical parts, opening locks or disarming alarm systems, or performing first aid.
GEAR|Personal Power Plant|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Expensive|(GC p. 155) For gatecrashers worried about being trapped on an exoplanet with no source of food, this nanoware system provides a solution. The nanobots in this system are powered by the isotope gadolinium-148. They transfer this nuclear energy to the body so that it is absorbed in a safe and consistent manner. This effec-tively fuels the body without the need to eat. With a half life of 78 years, the character can go for a century and possibly longer without regularly eating. A tiny bit of food consumption is still necessary to replace cells, though a small food stash could literally be stretched out for years. Likewise, vitamin and protein supplements would be necessary for long-term health, but as an alternative to starving to death, the personal power plant cannot be beat.
GEAR|Gait masking|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Expensive|(PO p. 149) Gait masking nanosystems alter the bone density, muscle tone, and shape of the user's feet and legs in minute but effective ways, altering their gait pattern just enough to avoid detection. The process of reconfiguration takes 20 minutes. Gait masking is illegal in many habitats. Gait masking can also be used to mimic an existing gait profile; apply a +30 modifier on Disguise Tests to fool gait biometric scanners.
GEAR|Nanotat ID Flux|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Expensive|(PO p. 149) This highly illegal system is a programmable version of the nanotat ID. Any new (fake) ID may be programmed in, and the nanotat may be reconfigured in seconds (1 Action Turn) to switch to another ID pattern in storage. This nanoware may not be configured for legal IDs unless they are actually legal or their encryption has been cracked.
GEAR|Skeletal Disguise|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Expensive|(PO p. 149) This implanted nanobot system is designed to disguise a subject's skeletal structure and create false sensor readings, either to avoid identification or to mimic an existing skeletal pattern. An existing pattern can only be mimicked if the character is of equivalent body mass and size. Altering the skeletal signature takes 20 minutes. Apply a -30 modifier to the scanner system's Perception Test.
GEAR|Bodysculpting|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 309) If your morph's enhanced physique isn't enough, you can take it further with custom bodysculpting such as as elongated ears or fingers, nose alteration, hair addition/removal, feathers, exotic eyes, snakeskin, endowed genitalia, and more unusual physical alterations.
GEAR|Nanotat|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 310) Tattoos created with nanobots can move around the body, change shape/color/brightness, texture, alternate text and images, and/or even create minor holographic effects on the skin's surface, all controllable via mesh inserts.
GEAR|Piercings|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Trivial|(EP p. 310) Name any part of the body and someone's figured out a way to pierce it, probably multiple times. Hoops, barbells, plugs, and chains are extremely common, often made of shapechanging smart materials.
GEAR|Scarification|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Trivial|(EP p. 310) Given modern medical abilities, scars of any sort are purely an affectation.
GEAR|Scent Alteration|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 310) Minor changes to a body's biochemistry can alter a character's natural smell or constantly perfume them.
GEAR|Skindyes|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Trivial|(EP p. 310) Dye jobs are available in all conceivable colors and patterns.
GEAR|Subdermal Implants|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Trivial|(EP p. 310) Adding small implants under the skin can create bumps, ridges, piercing anchors, and similar textures and alterations.
||||||||||||||||
GEAR|Hopper|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph|Moderate|(EP p. 310) Hoppers have two or more legs designed to propel the morph forward or up, much like a frog or grasshopper.
GEAR|Hovercraft|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph|Low|(EP p. 310) The shell uses an impeller to blast a cushion of high-pressure air off the surface below, repelling the frame off the ground (modern hovercraft do not use rubber skirts). Most hovercraft travel a meter or so above the ground, but can temporarily levitate themselves higher for short periods.
GEAR|Ionic|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph|High|(EP p. 310) The shell uses principles of magnetohydrodynamics to levitate and fly, by ionizing surrounding air into plasma to create lift and momentum. The shell is also spun for stability. This system does not work in vacuum, but an underwater version uses the same mechanics for propulsion in liquid environments.
GEAR|Microlight|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph|Low|(EP p. 310) Popular in low-grav and microgravity environments, microlights encompass several types of ultralight or lighter-than-air systems, such as powered paragliders, autogyros, balloons, aerostats, and blimps. These systems do not work in vacuum.
GEAR|Roller|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph|Moderate|(EP p. 310) Only for circular shells, this system allows the synthmorph to roll like a ball. The shell rolls around an interior axle, propelled by a motor-driven pendulum.
GEAR|Rotorcraft|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph|Low|(EP p. 310) Rotating blades create lift, allowing the shell to move and hover like a helicopter. Most models use tilt-rotors or tilt-wings so that the rotor blades may be moved forward (for faster propeller-like propulsion) and for better maneuverability in zero-G. This system does not work in vacuum.
GEAR|Snake|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph|Moderate|(EP p. 310) Commonly used by slitheroids, these shells use lateral undulation, flexing their body from left to right and waving their frame forward. Such shells may also use sidewinding or a concertina motion (straightening forward, then retracting the rear) to move. They also featured gyroscope stabilization so that they may circle into a hoop and roll like a wheel.
GEAR|Submarine|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph|Moderate|(EP p. 310) Designed for undersea mobility, submarine shells use propellers or pumpjets to push through water.
GEAR|Tracked|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph|Low|(EP p. 310) Tracked shells use smart rotating treads to work their way across surfaces that would bog down other ground vehicles. They can prop themselves up in order to overcome taller obstacles or to lay themselves down to bridge across a ditch or crevice.
GEAR|Thrust Vector|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph|Moderate|(EP p. 310) These shells use either turbofans or turbojets to create atmospheric lift with a set of wings. The engines may be maneuvered to point and generate thrust in different directions for vertical takeoffs/landings and better maneuverability in zero-G.
GEAR|Walker|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph|Low|(EP p. 310) Walkers use two or more limbs to walk or crawl across a surface. Many use grip pads or magnetic systems to stick to surfaces.
GEAR|Wheeled|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph|Low|(EP p. 310) Most wheeled shells feature smart spokes that allow the wheels to conform their shape to obstacles and even climb stairs. Some low-grav shells feature puncture-resistant and self-repairing compressed-gas tires.
GEAR|Winged|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph|Low|(EP p. 310) Primarily used by smaller shells, this system of four independently-controlled wings allows the shell to hover or move rapidly in any direction.
||||||||||||||||
GEAR|Extra Limb|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph|Low|(EP p. 310) The shell is equipped with one or more extra limbs. A character using these limbs suffers an off-hand modifier. These limbs may be arms (with hand/grippers/etc.), legs, tentacle-like, or otherwise articulated and/or prehensile. Some shells have rotational frames that allow them to move limbs around their body.
GEAR|Fractal Digits|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph|Moderate|"(EP p. 311) The synthmorph has ""bush robot"" digits that are capable of splitting into smaller digits, and those smaller digits into micro digits, and so on down to the micrometer scale, allowing for ultra-fine manipulation. Apply a +20 COO modifier where such fine manipulation is a factor (such as detailed repair work). The bot must have functioning nanoscopic vision to get this bonus."
GEAR|Hidden Compartment|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph|Low|(EP p. 311) The shell has a concealed aperture for a shielded interior compartment, ideal for storing valuables or smuggling contraband. Apply a -30 modifier to detect this compartment either manually or with sensor scans.
GEAR|Magnetic System|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph|Low|(EP p. 311) A magnetic system allows the shell to cling to most ferrous materials. This enables the character to walk in zero-G situations by magnetically adhering surfaces, hang upside down, and hold onto devices without letting them drop or drift away. The shell receives a +30 modifier whenever maintaining a magnetic hold on something.
GEAR|Modular Design|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph|High|(EP p. 311) This shell is designed to lock together with similar modular morphs in different architectural patterns to create larger gestalt forms. When united with other modules, the group is treated as a single unit/morph, with shared capabilities. If damaged and then separated, damage and wounds are distributed evenly between modules; uneven amounts are allocated randomly. The exact capabilities of different shapes depends on the composition, and is largely left in the gamemaster's hands.
GEAR|Pneumatic Limbs|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph|Low|(EP p. 311) The limbs are equipped with pneumatic cylinder systems that can generate up to 1,500 pounds of thrust. This allows the shell to push off and make impressive jumps (a synth of human size/weight can leap over 2 meters up). Apply a +20 to Freerunning Tests. A pneumatic limb used to strike an opponent in unarmed combat inflicts an extra 1d10 damage.
GEAR|Telescoping Limbs|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph|Low|(EP p. 311) The shell's limbs can either be retracted completely inside it's frame and/or extended for extra length (usually up to 1 or 2 meters extra). Telescoping limbs may give the shell a reach advantage in melee combat.
GEAR|Shape Adjusting|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph|High|(EP p. 311) This shell is made from smart materials that allow it to alter its shape, altering its height, width, circumference, and external features, while retaining the same mass. This modification is typically employed to reshape the morph into special configurations adapted to specific tasks (for example, lengthening to crawl through a tunnel, widening its base for stability, expanding to reach out and attach to multiple access point simultaneously, and so on). This mod also allows the morph to change its features for disguise purposes; apply a +30 modifier to Disguise Tests.
GEAR|Structural Enhancement|Augmentation||||||||10||||Synthmorph|Moderate|(EP p. 311) This modification bolsters the shell's structural integrity, boosting its ability to take damage. Increase Durability by 10 and Wound Threshold by 2.
GEAR|Swarm Composition|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph|High|"(EP p. 311) The shell is not a single unit but a swarm of hundreds of insect-sized robotic microdrones. Each individual ""bug"" is capable of crawling, rolling, hopping several meters, or using nanocopter fan blades for airlift. The cyberbrain, sensor systems, and implants are distributed throughout the swarm. Though the swarm can ""meld"" together into a roughly child-sized shape, the swarm is incapable of tackling physical tasks like grabbing, lifting, or holding as a unit. Individual bugs, however, are quite capable of interfacing with electronics. Swarms cannot carry most gear or wear armor, and may not make strength-based SOM-linked skill tests. For combat purposes, use the same rules as given for nanoswarms. Damage and wounds are reflected as damaged/massacred bugs. The swarm may be ""healed"" by manufacturing more bugs."
GEAR|Synthetic Mask|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph|Moderate|(EP p. 311) The synthmorph is equipped with a realistic outer casing of faux-skin and carefully sculpted to pass as a biomorph (perhaps even a particular person). The morph can cry, spit, have sex, and will even bleed if cut. Only a detailed physical examination or a radar, teraherz, or x-ray scan will detect the synthmorph's true nature, and even then such exams/scans suffer a -30 modifier.
#GEAR|Weapon Mount|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph|Low; Moderate for concealed/articulated| The shell carries a built-in (or built-on) weapon. This weapon mount may be either internal (concealed, only weapons small in relation to the shell may fit, -30 to Perception Tests to detect) or external (visible). It may be fixed (one direction only), swiveling (limited  field of fire), or on an articulated mount (all directions).
GEAR|Extreme Heat Shielding|Augmentation||||||||||-10:COO||Synthmorph|Expensive|(SW p. 166) This enhancement bolsters the synthmorph's tolerance to extremely high temperatures with heat-resistant materials, heat sinks, and bulky coolant systems. This modification increases the morph's Durability by 25% (not included) while reducing its Movement Rate by half (not included) and modifying COO by -10 (included). Morphs with his augmentation can withstand temperatures up to 500 C.
GEAR|Extreme Pressure Adaptation|Augmentation||||||||||-10:COO||Synthmorph|Expensive|(SW p. 167) Morphs with this mod undergo serious structural reinforcement, enabling them to withstand pressure of up to 100 atmospheres. This modification increases the morph's Durability by 50% (not included) while reducing its Movement Rate by half (not included)and modifying COO by -10 (included).
GEAR|Radiation Shielding|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph|High|(SW p. 167) This enhancement hardens the morph to exposure from electromagnetic and ionizing radiation. This will protect the morph in most situations that would be harmful to others, but at the gamemaster's discretion is only of limited effectiveness against extremely powerful sources of radiation (such as Jupiter's electromagnetic field) over prolonged periods.
GEAR|Invisibility|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph|Expensive|"(PO p. 149) This enhancement works much like the invisibility cloak. The shell is completely sealed within a layer of metamaterials with a negative refrac-tive index, making it invisible to the microwave and ultraviolet wavelengths and everything in between. This modification can only be applied to shells on which the entire outer surface can be coated (ionic, roller, snake, thrust vector, walker, wheeled, winged). At the gamemaster's discretion, this enhancement may not be applied to certain shells due to their configuration. Shells with this enhancement are effectively blinded, as they cannot use visual sensors (though they can view via meshed remote sensors), though they can also create temporary ""windows"" as with invisibility cloaks. This mod is not compatible with the radar absorbent, reduced signature, or radar invisibility mods."
GEAR|Radar Absorbent|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph|Moderate|(PO p. 149) The shell is constructed with materials that either pass, absorb, or trap radar and terahertz waves, reducing its sensor signature. Though sensor processing has improved significantly, radar absorbent materials can still provide some protection from detection. Apply a -20 modifier to detect the shell with radar and tera-hertz frequencies. This mod is compatible with the reduced signature mod.
GEAR|Reduced Signature|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph|High|(PO p. 149) This shell has been structurally modified to provide a much smaller radar cross-section. Shells with this modification have a very obvious streamlined, rounded and/or angular look, with no bulky pods or modules. External engines are instead incorporated into the frame. This enhancement is normally only applied to winged, rotorcraft, ionic, or thrust vector shells; apply a -30 modifier to detect these shells with radar and terahertz frequencies. For all other shells, a -10 modifier is applied. This modifier may not be applied to hoppers, tracked shells, or walkers while they are moving, as their mobility systems negate the advantage. The modifier from this enhancement is cumulative with the radar absorbent enhancement.
GEAR|Radar Invisibility|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph|Expensive|(PO p. 150) This shell is coated with a layer of radar-transparent metamaterials with a negative refractive index. It is effectively invisible to radar waves; they simply bend around the shell as if it were not there. The shell cannot be detected by radar, but is visible at other frequencies. This mod is not compatible with the invisibility, radar absorbent, or reduced signature mods, nor may it be used in conjunction with an invisibility cloak. Shells with this mod cannot detect radar themselves.
||||||||||||||||
GEAR|360-degree Vision|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 311) The shell's visual sensors are situated for a 360-degree field of vision.
GEAR|Chemical Sniffer|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Moderate|(EP p. 311) This sensor detects molecules in the air and analyzes their chemical composition. It enables Chemistry Tests to determine the presence of gases, including toxins and other fumes. It can also detect the presence of explosives and firearms.
GEAR|Lidar|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 311) This sensor emits laser light and measures the reflections to judge range, speed, and image the target. See Using Enhanced Senses.
GEAR|Nanoscopic Vision|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Moderate|(EP p. 311) The shell's visual sensors can focus like a microscope, using advanced superlens techniques to beat the optical diffraction limit and image objects as small as a nanometer. This allows the character to view and analyze objects as small as blood cells and even individual nanobots. The synthmorph must stay relatively steady to view objects at this scale.
GEAR|Radar System|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 311) This sensor system bounces radio or microwaves off targets and measures the reflected waves to judge size, composition, and motion. See Using Enhanced Senses.
||||||||||||||||
GEAR|Fiberoptic Cable|Communication||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Trivial|(EP p. 313) Fiberoptic cables are used to establish wired connections between two devices. Given the ubiquity of radios and the tangled mess wires cause, they are typically only used for privacy (unlike radio communication, fiberoptic signals may not be intercepted) or in areas with heavy radio interference.
GEAR|Laser/Microwave Link|Communication||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Moderate|(EP p. 314) These portable devices are used to establish a tight-beam, line-of-sight communications channel with another laser or microwave link. The range of these transceivers varies widely with environmental factors, but approximates 50 kilometers in atmosphere and 500 kilometers in space (though horizon limits must be kept in mind, being 5 kilometers at ground level on Earth and less on smaller bodies). Lasers are subject to interference from fog, dirt, smoke, and similar visual chaff, while microwaves may be hindered by metallic obstructions. These links may only be intercepted by getting directly in between the beams. Some teams carry a micro version of this system, worn on their person, allowing line of sight intra-team communications that cannot be intercepted like radio.
GEAR|Radio Booster|Communication||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 314) This device boosts the range and sensitivity of short-range radios, like those from implants, ectos, or microbugs. The booster must be with the shorter-ranged device's range (or directly linked via fiberoptic cable). It will repeat any transmissions received from that device, but at its extended range of 25 kilometers in urban areas (250 kilometers remote areas). Broadcasts from a radio booster are easy to receive by anyone looking for broadcasts, though transmissions may be stealthed. Boosters are commonly used by characters traveling far from habitats or other civilized regions.
GEAR|Neutrino Transceiver|Communication||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Expensive|(EP p. 314) This transceiver is capable of generating and receiving neutrino signals at a range of at least 100 astronomical units. It is large, with a size of 8 cubic meters (in a cube 2 meters on a side), but they can be loaded onto large vehicles. To function, it must be connected to a large power plant, such as one found in habitats or large spacecraft. The cost and size of this device includes the computer necessary for quantum farcasting.
GEAR|Miniature Radio Farcaster|Communication||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 315) Miniature farcasters communicate with each other using standard radio transceivers. As noted above, they may only securely communicate with the other farcasters with which they are entangled. Most miniature farcasters are worn as jewelry or fitted into clothing or other equipment.
GEAR|Portable QE Comm|Communication||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 315) This is a handheld FTL communications device. The actual communications unit can be made as small as desired, but must be large enough to connect to or hold a qubit reservoir. Because qubit reservoirs are relatively large and must be replaced, they are rarely implanted. Some miniature farcasters are designed so that users can also attach qubit reservoirs to enable them to be used for both light speed and FTL communication.
GEAR|Low-QBit Reservoir|Communication||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|High|(EP p. 315) Low-capacity qubit reservoirs can be used for 10 hours of high-resolution video conferencing or meshbrowsing and 100 hours of voice or text only communications.
GEAR|High-QBit Reservoir|Communication||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Expensive|(EP p. 315) High-capacity qubit reservoirs can be used for 100 hours of high-resolution video conferencing or meshbrowsing and 1,000 hours of voice or text only communications.
||||||||||||||||
GEAR|Chameleon Cloak|Espionage||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 315) This loose, poncho-like cloak contains a network of sensors that perceive wavelengths from microwave to ultra-violet. A similar network of miniature emitters precisely replicate the information its sensors receive, making the wearer seem transparent to those wavelengths. A chameleon cloak allows a character to effectively become invisible as long as they are stationary or not moving faster than a slow walk. When worn by someone moving faster, the cloak still provides a +30 modifier to Infiltration Tests to avoid being seen or noticed. Chameleon cloaks are not effective against radar, x-ray, or gamma-ray sensors. They do hide the character from thermal infrared, however, by absorbing the character's body heat into its heat sink. The cloak can only absorb a character's body heat for one hour before it must emit this heat. Heat emission also requires one hour, during which time the character is easily visible in the thermal infrared spectrum.
GEAR|Covert Ops Tool|Espionage||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|High|(EP p. 315) This handheld device is the ultimate in infiltration technology. It contains both smart matter micromanipulators, cutting tools, and an advanced nanotechnology generator capable of producing nanobots that can bore or cut through almost any material and disable or open almost any electronic lock. Cutting out a lock or boring a 1-millimeter hole in a wall with a COT requires ((Durability + Armor) / 10) seconds. Cutting out a 1-meter diameter hole in a wall requires ((Durability + Armor) / 10) minutes. These same nanobots can later be used to repair this damage so that it is invisible to any but the most careful and detailed examination. A COT can easily open any old-fashioned mechanical lock simply by analyzing it and shaping an appropriate key, though this takes a full Action Turn. It can also open electronic locks by infiltrating them with nanobots that influence the lock's electronics, no matter what authentication system the lock uses. Opening electronic locks takes a full Action Turn, but success is practically guaranteed. Opening an electronic lock in this manner will, however, trigger an alarm and/or be logged as an event.
GEAR|Cuffband|Espionage||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 316) This smart plastic loop restricts around a prisoner's limbs when activated. If the prisoner struggles, it will tighten more. Cuffbands will inform the user if they are cut or loosened and are electronically-controlled, so the user can release the prisoner remotely. Some cuffband variants including a shock system (treat as a shock baton) to zap and restrain unruly prisoners.
GEAR|Dazzler|Espionage||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Moderate|(EP p. 316) The dazzler is a tiny laser system set on a rotating ball. When activated, it consistently spins and emits laser pulses in all directions. These laser pulses are not dangerous, but they detect the lenses of camera systems (including specs, viewers, and bot/synthmorph sensors) and repeatedly zap them with laser pulses of varying strength to overload and dazzle them. For as long as a dazzler is active, any camera system (visual, infrared, and ultraviolet) within line of sight and within 200 meters is blinded.
GEAR|Disabler|Espionage||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|High|(EP p. 316) This handy device emits an overloading surge that completely incapacitates and disables a synthetic morph or pod (anything with a cyberbrain) when it is plugged into an access jack and activated. The affected cyberbrain will be unable to function until the signal is deactivated, effectively shutting down the ego (or AI). In order to plug a disabler into an unwilling target, the target must first be grappled or a called shot must be successfully made in melee combat. This device does not work on larger synthetic morphs (like vehicles) or on cyberbrainless robots.
GEAR|FiberEye|Espionage||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 316) This is a d exible and electronically-controllable length of fiberoptic cable and viewer, which can be worked through cracks, under doors, and around corners to peep unobtrusively.
GEAR|Invisibility Cloak|Espionage||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|High|(EP p. 316) This cloak is made of metamaterials with a negative refractive index, so that light actually bends around it, making it and anything it covers invisible. This invisibility works from the microwave to ultraviolet spectrums, but not against radar or x-rays. The drawback is that anything concealed within the cloak can't see out. This is easily overcome by using external sensor feeds (if available) and entoptics to navigate. Alternately, a small piece of anti-cloak, which cancels the cloak's invisibility properties when touched together, can be used to create a small window to peep out of, though this increases the chance of being spotted. Noticing such a window requires a Perception Test with a -30 modifier.
GEAR|Microbug|Espionage||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Trivial, Low for quantum farcaster bugs|(EP p. 316) This device is a tiny camera and microphone 1 millimeter across. It has the visual capabilities of a set of specs. It can hear everything within 20 meters and see everything within the same range that is in its line of sight. A microbug can record up to 100 hours of information. Microbugs can be set to broadcast continuously, at set intervals, or only when they receive a special signal. If desired, they can also be set to only record if there is movement or voices in the room they are in. Microbugs have adhesive backs and can stick to almost any surface. Microbugs can also establish their location via mesh positioning or GPS, and so double as tracking devices. To avoid being detected by their radio transmissions, some microbugs are attached to miniature quantum farcasters. These microbugs are much larger (1 centimeter) and easy to see, but their transmissions cannot be detected or blocked.
GEAR|Prisoner Mask|Espionage||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Medium|(EP p. 316) This hood tightens around the head of a prisoner, blocks all vision frequencies, and engages in low-level jamming in order to prevent any wireless communication via mesh inserts.
GEAR|Psi Jammer|Espionage||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Moderate|(EP p. 316) This device jams frequencies used by brainwaves within a 20-meter radius. This has no effect on brain functions, but it does prevent any ranged used of psi sleights within this area of effect.
GEAR|Quantum Computer|Espionage||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Expensive|(EP p. 316) These advanced devices make use of quantum computation, allowing them to handle extremely large numbers with ease. This makes them especially useful for codebreaking.
GEAR|Smart Dust|Espionage||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Moderate|(EP p. 316) This device is a walnut-sized specialized nanobot generator that creates tiny sensor nanobots, each one of which is a tiny sphere the diameter of a human hair. A packet of smart dust nanobots is sufficient to perform detailed surveillance on a large room like an auditorium has a volume of 1 cubic centimeter and contains 3 million nanobots. Each nanobot contains tiny cameras, microphones, a tiny computer, a radio, and chemical sensors, as well as short legs that allow them to walk and climb at a rate of 5 cm per second. When a character dumps a packet of smart dust in a room, it will cover every surface in the room within 20 minutes, including all furniture and the insides of every drawer and other space that is not airtight. At this point, the smart dust has recorded all data about the room that can be obtained by exceedingly detailed observation, including the DNA of everyone who has visited the room in the last week or two. The smart dust can then either broadcast a brief, highly compressed signal, or it can send all of its information to a few hundred nanobots that then walk to a pre-arranged destination for pickup and downloading by their user. The user need only find a single nanobot with a nanodetector to acquire the information obtained by the smart dust. If ordered to do so, the remaining nanobots can either power down and await further orders or self-destruct in a fashion that turns them into a tiny amount of dust made mostly of metal and silicon.
GEAR|Traction Pads|Espionage||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 317) This set of specialized fingerless gloves, shoes, and kneepads is designed to emulate the pads on geckos' feet. Characters can support themselves on a wall or ceiling by placing any two of these pads against any surface not made from a material specially designed to resist such devices. Characters can climb any surface and move easily across walls and ceilings that can support their weight (+30 to Climbing Tests). In addition to climbing, these devices are also very popular in zero-g environments. Wearing this item does not impair the user's agility or manual dexterity.
GEAR|White Noise Machine|Espionage||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Trivial|(EP p. 317) This small and wearable device generates masking sounds that protect a conversation from being audibly recorded or overheard by anyone not in the immediate vicinity.
GEAR|X-Ray Emitter|Espionage||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 317) This device is designed to be used with either the enhanced vision augmentation or specs. It emits a focused beam of low-powered x-rays that allows the user of either device to both see and see through most objects using backscatter x-ray radiation. This allows the character to literally see through walls and into containers, including ones made of metal.
||||||||||||||||
GEAR|Drive|Drug||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 318) This nootropic speeds up left-right brain hemisphere communication, stimulates idea production, and improves concentration, with no usual side effects. Users receive a +5 bonus to COG while the drug lasts.
GEAR|Klar|Drug||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|"(EP p. 318) Klar boosts alertness and enhances clarity and perception. Users report a feeling of being ""elevated"" to a higher level. They receive +5 INT while the drug lasts."
GEAR|Neem|Drug||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Moderate|"(EP p. 318) Neem is a mnemonic drug that works by ""tagging"" experiences and mental input with a set of unique sensations that contribute to the formation of state-based memories. Neem gummy chews come in a variety of fruit flavors shaped like extinct old Earth animals. Neem gives characters a +20 bonus on COG Tests to recall information they learned while on Neem. The drawback to Neem is that memories they accumulate while under the drug's influence have no emotional association. For example, a character who witnessed something horrible happening to a friend or who had a fight with a romantic partner while on Neem would feel no emotional connection whatsoever to what happened."
GEAR|BringIt|Drug||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 319) In some respects more a social than a combat drug, BringIt stimulates massive bursts of aggression pheromones designed to make the user the center of attention in a fight. In combat, opponents within 3 meters of the character not already in unarmed or melee combat with another character must pass a WIL x 3 Test or attack the character using BringIt. The nature of airborne pheromones is imprecise, however, so if the character using BringIt is within 1 meter of another character hostile to the character affected, the affected character may opt to attack the proximate character instead of the BringIt user. Characters using this drug suffer a -20 modifier on social skill tests.
GEAR|Grin|Drug||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 319) Grin is an effective opiate and pain suppressant. Users may ignore the -10 modifiers from 2 wounds (not cumulative with similar effects), and in fact may not even be aware they are injured. Grin users suffer from tunnel vision, however, and so suffer a -10 modifier on Perception Tests.
GEAR|Kick|Drug||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Moderate|(EP p. 319) Kick is a strong stimulant that increases the user's response time and puts them on edge. The character gains +10 REF and +1 Speed for the duration of the drug. Characters under the influence of Kick are twitchy, however, reacting in a jumpy, cat-like fashion to sudden or unexpected stimuli. At the gamemaster's discretion, they must make a WIL x 2 Test or react without thinking towards unexpected noises or other surprises. Long-term users suffer -5 COO.
GEAR|MRDR|Drug||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 319) MRDR is a straightforward and brutal combat drug. It increases pain tolerance, speed, and strength. The character receives +10 SOM, +1 Speed, +10 Durability, and may ignore the -10 modifier of one wound. Any damage incurred while under the effects of the drug is taken from the bonus Durability first. MRDR users are easily identifiable by the broken blood vessels in their eyes, tense posture, and visible tension in the muscles of the face, arms, and legs. Long-term users suffer -5 SOM.
GEAR|Phlo|Drug||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Moderate|(EP p. 319) Phlo increases alertness and coordination, making the user more graceful and nimble in a fray. The character gains +5 COO and +10 on Perception Tests for the duration of the drug. Everything feels possible to a character on Phlo, and so they are vulnerable to being goaded into actions that might be foolish or dangerous (apply a -10 modifier to appropriate Social Skill Tests).
GEAR|Bananas Furiosas|Drug||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 319) This drug reverses some of the effects of de-ionizing radiation on the cells of the body. Although a pill form is available, it most commonly comes in large bunches of bright orange-red bananas. Bananas reduce the severity of a radiation dosage (gamemaster determines effect).
GEAR|Comfurt|Drug||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 320) This tasty yogurt treat blocks stress hormones, stabilizes mood, and relieves anxiety, allowing them to ignore the effect of 1 trauma and temporarily boosting Lucidity by +5. Any stress suffered while the drug is in effect is taken from the bonus Lucidity first. Comfurt also provides a +10 bonus when resisting attempts to manipulate the user's emotions. Excessive use of Comfurt can lead to chronic itchiness caused by histamine release.
GEAR|Buzz|Drug||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Moderate|"(EP p. 320) This gene-modified variant of BZ is an odorless, invisible, extremely powerful hallucinogen. Users or affected characters will undergo extremely realistic hallucinations for the duration, and may even ""share"" hallucinations with other affected characters. Characters will suffer a -30 modifier to any tests to remember what occurred while under the influence."
GEAR|Mono No Aware|Drug||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 320) Taken from the Japanese term for sadness at the ephemerality of worldly things, this drug, typically ingested as a tea, is a depressant that induces a meditative state. Mono No Aware gives the character a +10 bonus on Art and Sense Tests. With frequent use, Mono No Aware reacts with pigments in the skin to create a pallor with a slight bluish tinge, even in darker-skinned morphs.
GEAR|Orbital Hash|Drug||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|"(EP p. 320) Good ol' reefer""but grown in space using powerful lighting and post-singularity hydroponics. Because space is at a premium in habitats and scum barges, blocks of hashish are the preferred mode of transport and delivery. However, for the wealthy and on planets, buds in leaf form are not uncommon. Hash allows the character to ignore the effects of 1 trauma, but inflicts a -10 penalty on all memory-related tests and Knowledge Skill Tests. Hash users exhibit blood-shot eyes, lethargic behaviors, and the munchies."
GEAR|Alpha|Drug||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|High|(EP p. 320) Alpha is a more subtle version of BringIt, popular with hypercorp execs, street thugs, and anyone else who wants to come across as a domineering asshole. The pharm designer who invented it had a retro sensibility (and maybe a sick sense of humor); Alpha is typically synthesized as a sparkling white powder designed to be snorted. Alpha stimulates production of threat pheromones, but less bluntly than BringIt. Alpha imparts con dence, a feeling of power, and alertness. Users can function without sleep for 4 days, after which point they need to catch up with at least 4 hours of sleep (remember morphs with basic biomods require less sleep). Dosed characters receive a +20 modifier on Intimidation Tests and +10 on Persuasion and Networking Tests where attitude is a factor (gamemaster discretion). These bonuses only apply to characters within 2 meters of the Alpha user. On the downside, alpha users are impatient, unfocused assholes. At the gamemaster's discretion, Social skill modifiers may be reversed to penalties with certain types of people. Additionally, Alpha users suffer -10 on all COG skill tests related to memory and coherent or logical thinking. Long-term users may suffer the COG penalty even when not on the drug; on it, they may be worse.
GEAR|Hither|Drug||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 321) Want to ooze sexy like a pleasure morph on a hot tin roof? For those desiring that slinky je-ne-sais-quoi, Hither is the tool. Hither is a clear, slippery gel, sometimes with a faint, musky, floral scent. Hither is applied to parts of the body with large concentrations of sweat glands, where the skin quickly absorbs it. Hither is a mild euphoriant, imparting a feeling of confidence and you-know-you-want-it-ness to the user. It also stimulates abundant production of lust pheromones. The character gains a +10 bonus on Persuasion Tests against targets who are possible to seduce. At the gamemaster's discretion, this extends to Deception, Impersonate, and Networking Tests.
GEAR|Juice|Drug||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|"(EP p. 321) This potent anti-depressant makes it almost impossible to have bad feelings or negative thoughts. The character is unnaturally happy""often irritatingly or strangely so. The character receives a +30 bonus against fear or attempts to manipulate their emotions in a negative direction, but is also likely to act inappropriately, like giggling over the massive amount of spilled blood or cheerfully changing the subject to inane topics when someone else is freaking out."
||||||||||||||||
GEAR|Frequency|Nanodrug||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Moderate|(EP p. 321) Frequency (or Freeq) is a nanodrug designed as a tool for scientific visualization. It releases a small swarm of nanobots into the character's bloodstream that settle in the epidermis, where they act as sensors of electromagnetic radiation. This sensory input is then injected into the character's visual and tactile sensoria, hitting the user with a sequence of novel stimuli, typically a light show or weird tactile sensations. Aside from its recreational uses, Frequency is good at picking up on localized field radiation with a standard Perception Test. A character can take advantage of this to spot sensors and hidden electronics. Similar to now-obsolete 20th-century hallucinogens like LSD and psilocybin, however, a Frequency trip can be disorienting and upsetting (the gamemaster should apply any modifiers, mental stress, or even trauma as they feel appropriate). Characters typically experience a period about 1/3 of the way through their trip in which sensory input is extremely intense; during this period, which usually lasts about 2 hours, they are unable to read.
GEAR|Gravy|Nanodrug||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 321) Gravy assists characters in acclimating to high gravity environments. It comes in a variety of flavors and is often added as a sauce to food. For Gravy to be 100% effective, the character must begin using it in advance. Reduce penalties for high-gravity acclimation by 20.
GEAR|Schizo|Nanodrug||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 321) Schizo is a nanodrug that mirrors the effects of paranoid schizophrenia. It is popular in some hyperelite social circles as a truly daring and intriguing experience. A dose of schizo looks like a disposable antique razor blade. Making an incision in the skin releases a swarm of nanobots that travel to the central nervous system and induce the effects of the drug. While in effect, the character is severely paranoid and hears voices. How this plays out is at the discretion of the gamemaster, but should include irrational fears, unusual compulsions based on the instructions of the voice or voices, and a strong possibility that the character will behave in a violent or destructive fashion. The character may make WIL x 3 Tests to avoid violent acts against objects or strangers. Friends and trusted acquaintances are probably less likely to be targets of violence (+30 modifier to avoid hurting people the character cares about or destroying important possessions). Note that the character's muse is unaffected by Schizo and can make efforts to babysit the character. Characters who take Schizo suffer 1d10 mental stress.
#GEAR|Petal (Trivial)|Nanodrug||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Trivial|" Petals is a term for a type of narrative hallucinogen, a nanodrug that hijacks the senses and takes the user on a game-like, highly immersive trip. Known by a myriad of intriguing names""Forgotten Hand, Darkly Selving, Inquisitive Green, to name a few""Petals are post-Fall society's heroin""the drug of choice for the desperate and fucked. Petals almost always appear as nanopharmaceutical owers, potted or with a nutrient pack attached to the stem. Plucking and swallowing the petals from the flower triggers the effects immediately. Flowers have 5-10 petals. Multiple users may share the experience if they take the Petals within 1 minute of the first one being plucked; after this all petals remaining on the flower fade to translucent white and become inert. Petal experiences are like entire scenarios in and of themselves. Some take place entirely in the user's mesh inserts (the user must cede control of their implants voluntarily; if they do not, the drug has no effect other than producing very low-intensity LSD-like visual hallucinations), taking control of the character's entoptic displays, linking to secretive mesh servers and other trippers, and invading the character's sensorium with AR ""hallucinations."" Others put the character into a near-comatose state during which they go on a head trip. Normally there is some kind of well-developed theme or plot to a Petal experience, although in some cases they just experience a stream of images. Though most societies seek to suppress Petals, new ones appear constantly, fueled by a persistent sub-culture of crafters and users. Petalcrafters view their work as an art form (or at least as really good entertainment), and the better Petals are lovingly crafted, hauntingly beautiful experiences""even if they're also terrifying. The subculture of Petal use ranges from casual users who occasionally do an easy, short-duration flower to hardcore addicts who spend much of their time not on Petals trying to hunt down the most intense and esoteric varieties. From this subculture comes a lot of information on what various Petals look like and their effects. Because Petals combine custom nanobots with tailored chemical payloads and sometimes connections to mesh servers, duplicating them using fabricators is impossible, leading to an active market of crafters, dealers, and traders. Petals sometimes contain easter eggs and rewards, called ""sweets"" by petal users. Getting the sweets usually requires fulfilling certain conditions within the trip, such as correctly answering questions or fulfilling goals. Typical sweets include skillsofts, new clothing or product designs, and custom infomorph sleeves. On the negative side, some Petal trips go bad, inflicting 1d10 mental stress or more on the user. Perhaps worse, some Petals are loaded with malware that takes over the user's mesh inserts and worse""some sentinels even whisper of Petals carrying strains of the Exsurgent virus."

GEAR|DDR|Narcoalgorithm||||||||||||Infomorph,Synthmorph,Pod|Low|"(EP p. 323) Originally crafted by prankster hackers and distributed as a virus, DDR (for ""Dance Dance Robot"") triggers impulses in the target's motor control circuits. Primary targeting robot AIs, the effect is that targets ""dance"" in jerky, automated movements. Pleasure receptors are also activated so that dancing""and movement of any kind""feels good. Different software variants invoke different motions and styles. The target suffers a -20 modifier on other actions while dancing, but the dancing may be overridden with a WIL x 3 Test."
GEAR|Linkstate|Narcoalgorithm||||||||||||Infomorph,Synthmorph,Pod|Low|"(EP p. 323) This software actually connects the user to a peer-to-peer network, where it randomly connects to other linkstate users and samples a bit of their XP feed and randomly accessed memories""typically just enough to provide context, but not enough to acquire private personal details. These inputs are spliced together, their emotional inputs amplified, and then the entire package is spiked with some hormonal circuit triggers and artificial synaesthesia. The effect is a mind-blowing mixed sampling of people's lives, mashed together in a sensory soup, that hits the mind with a euphoric rush. Linkstate users are catatonic while under the effects (typical sessions run 3-4 hours), but afterwards they often report that they have flashbacks of events in other people's lives."

It is ignited with an electric charge, burning at temperatures exceeding 2,500 degrees Celsius and melting through whatever it is touching. Liquid thermite inflicts 3d10 + 5 DV per Action turn to whatever it is touching. Armor will also be burnt through, offering no protection once the full Armor rating has been reached.

Affected characters suffer 1d10 / 2 damage, a -30 modifier to sight-based Perception Tests, and a -20 modifier to all other actions for 20 minutes (5 minutes if the character has medichines).
GEAR|Flight|Toxin||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 324) This drug is derived from human pheromones released due to fear, and is intended to instill alarm or even terror in the character. Affected characters must make a WIL x 3 Test (+30 with medichines) or suffer a panic attack, inflicting 1d10 stress. Dosed characters also suffer a -30 modifier for resisting intimidation or fear-based emotional manipulations. Flight affects last for 1 hour (5 minutes with medichines).
GEAR|Nervex|Toxin||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|High|(EP p. 324) Derived from deadly nerve agents like cyclosarin, VX, and novichok, this genetically-modified toxin is deployed as a colorless, odorless gas that turns safely inert 10 minutes after deployment. It causes involuntary contraction of the muscles, seizures, and death by respiratory failure. One minute after exposure, the character must make a SOM Test or be incapacitated by seizures, paralysis, or nausea and vomiting; unaffected characters still suffer a -20 modifier to all actions. After 10 minutes, the character will die unless an antidote (such as atropine) is applied. Characters with medichines suffer the initial effects, but recover after 5 minutes.
GEAR|Oxytocin-A|Toxin||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 324) A genetically-improved variant of oxytocin, this drug induces trust in the recipient. Drugged characters suffer a -30 modifier on all WIL and Kinesics Tests where trust is a factor. Medichines provide immunity.
GEAR|Twitch|Toxin||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 324) Twitch is a convulsive agent, a nonlethal nerve gas. Affected characters must succeed in a SOM Test (+30 with medichines) or become incapacitated with severe muscle tremors. Unaffected characters still suffer a -20 on all actions. The effects of Twitch last for 10 minutes, 5 if the character has medichines.

GEAR|Disruption|Nanotoxin||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Moderate|(EP p. 324) This nanotoxin attacks the myelin sheath on nerves, disrupting nerve impulses and inflicting symptoms of multiple sclerosis. Every hour the morph suffers a -5 modifier to COO, REF, and COG. If any aptitudes are reduced to zero,the morph is effectively paralyzed and catatonic.
GEAR|Necrosis|Nanotoxin||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Moderate|(EP p. 324) Necrosis nanobots attack the walls of cells inside the body, killing tissue. This nanotoxin inflicts 1d10 / 2 damage per Action Turn for one minute, after which the nanobots disable and flush from the body. Necrosis only affects biomorphs.
GEAR|Neuropath|Nanotoxin||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Moderate|(EP p. 324) These nanobots are designed to stimulate the pain receptors of a morph on a systemic level to cause agony and impairment. While most neuropaths target biological receptors, variants are available that induce comparable (phantom) pain stimulations in the cyberbrains of synthmorphs to create an equivalent effect. The affected character must succeed in a WIL x 3 Test or become incapacitated. Even if they succeed, they suffer -30 from the inflicted agony. Any form of pain resistance that allows a character to ignore wound modifiers will negate the neuropath pain modifier by an appropriate amount.
GEAR|Nutcracker|Nanotoxin||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|High|(EP p. 324) Nutcrackers are nanobots designed to locate, migrate, and decompose the synthdiamond case of a cortical stack within a morph by attacking its crystal lattice. This process takes approximately 6 hours, after which the cortical stack is destroyed. These nanobots also attack the cortical stack's connections to the (cyber)brain and brain-mapping nanobots. After 1 hour, the victim will be aware that their cortical stack is threatened. After 3 hours, all connections will be severed and the cortical stack will no longer be able to back up the character.
||||||||||||||||
GEAR|Degen|Pathogen||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Expensive|(EP p. 324) Characters exposed to this degenerative neurological disease must make a DUR x 2 Test or become infected. Medichines will defeat the disease, but others will not show signs of infection for 1 week, when the symptoms of a rapidly progressing dementia will become clear: memory loss, personality changes, and hallucinations. If untreated, Degen will progress for another week with more serious symptoms, including speech impediments, jerky movements, loss of balance and coordination, and even seizures. This is reflected by a 5 point loss in all aptitudes per day (after the first week). When any aptitude reaches 0, the character dies. Degen is notorious for its effect in corrupting cortical stack backups before infection symptoms manifest.
GEAR|Trigger|Pathogen||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Expensive|(EP p. 324) Trigger is a designer virus that selectively targets and infects mast cells to trigger a hyper-allergic reaction. The resulting anaphylactic shock due to systemic vasodilatation (associated with a sudden drop in blood pressure) and bronchial swelling (resulting in constriction and difficulty breathing) usually leads to death in a matter of minutes after onset, if not treated. Infected characters must succeed in a DUR Test (using their current Durability score minus damage) or die quickly. Even medichines have difficulty reacting in time against this virus; characters with medichines must make a DUR x 2 Test to survive.
||||||||||||||||
GEAR|Inhibitor|Psi-drug||||||||||||Biomorph,Pod,Uplift|High|(EP p. 325) Inhibitor is a cocktail of neurochemicals that block some brain receptor and transmitter functions in an attempt to reduce psi-waves and block or impair sleights. This drug is commonly used to restrain async prisoners from using their abilities. A drugged character must make a WIL x 2 Test. If they fail, they lose all psi abilities for the drug's duration. If they succeed, they suffer a -30 impairment on Psi skills and all strain is doubled. Inhibitor has an unfortunate side effect of doping the character down, however; apply a -10 modifier to their COG. Inhibitor-influenced characters tend to have a glazed, dopey expression and have difficulty getting excited or emotional.
GEAR|Psi-Opener|Psi-drug||||||||||||Biomorph,Pod,Uplift|Expensive|(EP p. 325) Psi-opener drugs are variants of the Watts-MacLeod strain with a temporary effect and which do not permanently alter the user's brain. Psi-opener temporarily imbues the user with the ability to use one particular sleight, regardless of whether or not they have the Psi trait. Each type of Psi-opener is customized for a particular sleight. While primarily intended for non-asyncs, non-asyncs may not possess Psi skills, so they must default to WIL. For this reason, Psi-Opener is often doubled up with Psike-out. Using Psi-opener is a mind-wrenching experience. Users are occasionally subject to hallucinations (gamemaster discretion). When the drug wears off, it inflicts 1d10 points of mental stress, +2 if the drug imbues a psi-gamma sleight.
GEAR|PsikeOut|Psi-drug||||||||||||Biomorph,Pod,Uplift|Expensive|(EP p. 325) Psike-out bolsters an async's psi abilities. Apply a +20 modifier to the async's Psi skill tests for the drug's duration. However, also apply +2 to all strain DVs for the drug's duration. Psike-out is mentally addictive, with an Addiction Modifier of -10.

GEAR|Ecto|Everyday/Common||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 325) Ectos are the external version of basic mesh inserts, minus the medical sensors. These colorful devices serve as a wearable mesh terminal, PDA, locator, and camera-phone. The devices are flexible (often worn as bracelets), dirt-resistant, self-cleaning, and may be stretched out to increase screen size. They may project holographic displays and are typically equipped with wireless-enabled glasses or contact lenses and decorative earpieces or earrings so that the user may access augmented reality. Given the ubiquity of mesh inserts, ectos are growing less common, but they are still used by bioconservatives, others without implants, and those who prefer to access the mesh via an external device for security concerns.
GEAR|Holographic Projectors|Everyday/Common||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 325) These devices are capable of projecting high-definition, ultra-realistic three- dimensional images and movies. From a distance (20+ meters), such holograms can be difficult to distinguish as fake, but up close they are easier to see for what they are (+20 Perception Test modifier). Holograms do not appear wavelengths other than visual light, and so are easily identified by anyone with enhanced vision.
GEAR|Micrograv Shoes|Everyday/Common||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Trivial|(EP p. 325) These shoes are equipped with velcro and/or a magnetic system, allowing the wearer to walk normally on appropriate surfaces in micrograv and zero-G environments, rather than floating or bouncing.
GEAR|Portable Sensor|Everyday/Common||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Moderate|(EP p. 325) This is a small portable (possibly even wearable) sensor system. The type of sensor must be chosen (for example: infrared, lidar, radar, x-ray). Combined sensor systems are also available, at a cumulative cost.
GEAR|Smart Clothing|Everyday/Common||||||0/0|FALSE|||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|Smart clothing can change its color, texture, and even its cut, taking only a minute or two to transform from a solid color jumpsuit to a plaid party dress or a replica of a pinstriped, late 20th century business suit. It can also camouflage the wearer, providing a +20 bonus to Infiltration Tests to avoid being seen, as long as the wearer is stationary or not moving faster than a slow walk, and as long as the wearer is completely covered or also using chameleon skin of the same color/pattern. If incompletely camoufaged, or if moving faster, reduce the modifier to +10. Smart clothing also keeps the character warm or cool, allowing the character to exist comfortably in environments from -40 to 70 C.
GEAR|Smart Vac Clothing|Armor,Everyday/Common||||||2/4|FALSE|||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Moderate| Just like regular smart clothing, this outfit can also transform into a light vacsuit. It also functions as armor with a rating of 2/4.
GEAR|Specs|Everyday/Common||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 326) Specs are vision-enhancing glasses. They deliver sensory data directly into the wearer's visual cortex by connecting with their basic mesh inserts, though visual displays are available for bio-conservatives and other characters without implants. Specs extend the range of the wearer's vision from terahertz waves to gamma rays. Specs include a t-ray emitter, however, using x-rays, or gamma rays for visual purposes requires a separate emitter, since neither of these sorts of radiation are common inside habitats, or in any safe environments. Specs have a variable focus equivalent to 5 power magnifiers and provide the wearer with a +10 bonus to all Perception Tests involving vision.
GEAR|Utilitool|Everyday/Common||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 326) This hand tool includes a specialized small nanobot generator. In its basic form, a utilitool is the size and shape of a large fountain pen. It can transform into almost any tool, however, from a wrench, knife, or powered screwdriver to a rotary grinder or pair of pliers. Some inexpensive utilitools are optimized for specialized tasks, like cooking or wilderness survival, but more expensive models become almost any imaginable hand tool. Utilitools are normally mentally controlled using the character's basic mesh inserts. Characters without such implants can control the tool via voice commands and touch controls. Characters using a utilitool gain a +10 modifier to skills involving repairing or modifying devices with mechanical parts, opening locks, disarming alarm systems, or performing first aid.
GEAR|Viewers|Everyday/Common||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 326) These small and highly advanced binoculars possess all the visual enhancement of specs, but also provide 50x magnification. They also include a directional microphone that magnifies sound from the direction the viewers are pointed by a factor of 50. Viewers provide the user with a +30 bonus to all Perception Tests involving vision or hearing for the target they are aimed at. This bonus is not cumulative with bonuses from any other device or augmentation.
||||||||||||||||
GEAR|Healing Vat|Nanotechnology||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|High|(EP p. 326) Healing vats were the first type of nanotech medicine developed and remain the most powerful medical devices in common use. With the exception of a few exceptionally deadly nanoplagues, a healing vat can cure any disease and heal any injury. As long as the patient is alive when they are place in the healing vat, they will not only survive, but emerge without a scratch. A healing vat can even take a severed head (as long as it has been stabilized by medichines or nanotech first aid) and regrow an entire body based on the head's genetics. If the patient's body or medical records contain information about their implants, bioware, or advanced nanotechnology, all of these modifications are also fully restored. Few people suffer injuries serious enough to require a healing vat. Most are used as a safe and easy way to perform bodysculpting or to install implants or bioware. Healing vats use specialized nanomachines to either alter the patient's body or integrate implants or bioware. One advantage of using a healing vat is that no additional healing time is needed, the patient leaves the vat fully recovered from the augmentation and ready to go. Every hospital, clinic, bodyshop, and augmentation parlor has several healing vats. The time required by a healing vat varies with the severity of the damage it is healing or the extent of the modification being made, as noted on the Healing Vat table.
GEAR|Nanodetectors|Nanotechnology||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 327) Nanodetectors are small devices that suck in air and micro debris in order to scan for and detect nanobots. Given that nanobots are so small, the density of nanobots in the area has a large impact on its success. The nanodetector has a base skill of 30 for detecting nanobots, modified by +30 if an active nanoswarm or hive is present, +0 if a nanoswarm or hive was active recently, and -10 for the presence of nanobots outside of a swarm or hive. Once a nanobot is detected it may be analyzed either by the user or the nanodetectors AI, using Academics: Nanotechnology 30 skill. Nanodetectors are often worn and left on, set to alert the user if a hostile nanoswarm is detected. [Low]
GEAR|Desktop Cornucopia Machine|Nanotechnology||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Expensive|(EP p. 327) Cornucopia machines (CMs) are general-purpose nanofabricators. The smallest CMs are desk-sized cubes approximately half a meter on a side with a volume of at least 40 liters. They can produce any small object, from tools to well-folded suits of clothing to handguns or a bowl of cereal. It is sometimes possible to assemble larger items, but they must be manufactured in smaller pieces and then assembled (likely requiring an appropriate Hardware Test). While users can purchase bulk raw materials, CMs also come equipped with a disassembler. The user loads garbage and other objects into the disassembler so that they can be turned into raw materials for the CM. All legally-available disassemblers only deconstruct non-living material.
GEAR|Fabber|Nanotechnology||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Moderate|(EP p. 328) Fabbers are specialized nanofabricators, portable and considerably smaller than CMs. There are a wide variety of portable fabbers, including ones that can make any hand tool or small piece of personal electronics, ones that can turn any organic material into food and drink, and ones that can create any drug or medicine as well as bandages and specialized dressings. The most common fabbers have a volume of 4 liters. Larger hand tools and devices are produced as 2 or 3 separate parts that must be fitted together. Like CMs, fabbers also contain miniature disposal units.
GEAR|Maker (Low)|Nanotechnology||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 328) Makers are specially-designed to produce food and drink for the user. Raw materials can be provided by the addition of any water-containing liquid and collected biomass like leftover food, grass, dirt, dead animals, or transhuman waste. Some models are built into standard vacsuits. Makers can produce water and various  flavored beverages, as well as ration bars or thick pudding-like edible gels. With adequate raw material, a maker can indefinitely provide food and drink for up to three transhumans. Most units, however, have a very limited range of flavors and textures that are widely considered to be fairly bad. Models with a wider and better range of flavors and textures are more expensive, but produce food that is considered adequate or occasionally good.

The cost of such blueprints typically exceeds the cost of purchasing the item, though factors like legality and quality may affect the cost as usual.
GEAR|General Hive|Nanotechnology||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Expensive|(EP p. 328) General hives are capable of producing any conceivable type of nanobot with the right blueprints and/or programming. Even at their smallest size they are not really portable, with a minimum size being cubes 30 centimeters on a side and a volume of 25 liters.
GEAR|Specialized Hive|Nanotechnology||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Moderate, plus price of programmed swarm|(EP p. 328) Specialized hives are far more common than general hives, though they can produce only one type of nanomachines (i.e., choose one type of nanoswarm per hive). The smallest specialized hives are approximately the size of a 12-gauge shotgun shell or a large cherry tomato.
GEAR|Ego Bridge|Nanotechnology||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Expensive|(EP p. 328) Ego bridges are vat devices used for uploading and downloading minds. See Backups and Uploading, and Resleeving.
GEAR|Cleaners|Nanotechnology||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 329) This nanoswarm cleans, polishes, and removes dirt and stains. It may be used on an area, specific objects, or people. Some facilities employ permanent cleaner swarms to keep their area spotless. Cleaners may also be programmed to remove specific toxins, chemicals, or other hazardous substances in order to decontaminate an area. Covert operatives and criminals sometimes use cleaners to eliminate any evidence they may have left at a scene usable for forensics purposes, such as blood, hair, or anything that could be DNA-typed.
GEAR|Disassemblers|Nanotechnology||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|High|(EP p. 329) Also known as smart corrosives, these nanobots break down any matter. Their advantage over common acids is that not only are they able to break down any material by using energy to disrupt chemical bonds, but that they can be programmed to take apart certain components while ignoring others, leaving them intact. Disassemblers are a common weapon used against synthmorphs, eating away their components without having to worry about accidentally splashing biomorphs. Upon contact, these nanobots inflict 1d10 / 2 damage (round up) per Action Turn. Accumulated damage counts as a wound when the Wound Threshold is reached. Both Energy and Kinetic armor protect against this damage, but these armors are eaten away as well, so the Armor Value is reduced by the soaked DV.
GEAR|Engineers|Nanotechnology||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Moderate|(EP p. 329) Engineer microswarms are used for various construction purposes: erecting walls, digging tunnels, sealing holes, reinforcing foundations, and so on.

The proteans must be able to scavenge appropriate raw materials (for example, to create a metallic device the nanobots must transform something else made of metal). The construction time takes 1 hour per cost category of the item (1 hour for a Trivial cost item, 2 hours for Low, etc.).
GEAR|Saboteurs|Nanotechnology||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Moderate|(EP p. 329) This microswarm is useful for a number of agricultural purposes: killing weeds, planting seeds, trimming plants, pollinating, and even harvesting small items.

GEAR|Scouts|Nanotechnology||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|High|(EP p. 329) A scout nanoswarm will systematically map and explore an area, collecting samples of all materials and substances it encounters. The samples are carried back to the hive or canister and chemically analyzed. Scouts can also be used for forensic purposes, collecting DNA samples, analyzing chemical residues, and examining other evidence.
GEAR|Taggants|Nanotechnology||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 329) Taggants seek to lodge themselves onto everything in their area of dispersal. Each carries a unique identifier, so that if it is found later, the tagged person or object can be linked back to the point they were tagged. Taggants can be programmed to remain silent, only responding to query broadcasts made with the proper crypto codes, or they can be programmed to broadcast their location back to the deployer via the mesh.

Still of only (enhanced) animal intel-ligence, they are typically fielded in groups of two to seven with police handlers. Working as a police baboon handler is an extremely dangerous job, as the baboons have been known to turn as a pack upon their handler in mentally stressful situations, such as when attacked with sensory or nerve agents, or more rarely when subjected to psi or encounters with exsurgents. Nonetheless, baboon units remain popular with police commanders for tracking, crowd control, and guarding prisoners. Baboons are frighteningly strong, and a pack of them can easily immobilize most pris-oners""or tear them apart, if commanded. They are sometimes equipped with body armor and clubs.

GEAR|Superthermite Charges|Scavenged Tech||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Moderate|(EP p. 330) These powerful and highly stable demolition charges are made from a combination of nanometals and metal oxides. A single charge can be used to create an explosive blast inflicting 2d10+5 damage. This charge can be shaped with a successful Demolitions Test, focusing the blast in a particular 90-degree direction (for example, to blow through a door). This triples the damage of the blast in the focused direction; in all other directions, the damage is reduced to 1/3rd (round down). Multiple charges apply a cumulative effect.

GEAR|Bedlam|Scorcher||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|High|(EP p. 332) Bedlam programs assault the ego with traumatic mental input, inflicting mental stress. Victims are overwhelmed with horrific, monstrous, sanity-ripping sensory and emotional input. Each attack inflicts 1d10 SV.
GEAR|Cauterizer|Scorcher||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|High|(EP p. 332) This scorch program rips into the ego with destructive neurofeedback routines. Each attack with a cauterizer inflicts 1d10 + 5 DV on the target ego. This damage is reflected as digitized neurological damage.
GEAR|Nightmare|Scorcher||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|High|(EP p. 332) Nightmare programs trigger anxiety and panic attacks within the victim by stimulating the neural circuitry representing the amygdala and hippocampus. The target ego must make a WIL x 2 Test. If they succeed, they are shaken but otherwise unaffected, suffering a -10 modifier to all actions until the end of the next Action Turn. If they fail, they suffers 1d10 / 2 stress damage and are overcome with panic. This causes them either to blindly flee, have a nervous breakdown, or cower in frozen shock (gamemaster's discretion). This panic episode lasts for 1 Action Turn per 10 points of MoF.
GEAR|Shutter|Scorcher||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|High|(EP p. 332) Shutters target the victim's sensory cortices, inflicting a -30 modifier to one chosen sense.

GEAR|Breadcrumb Positioning System|Survival Gear||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|" This worn device leaves micro ""breadcrumbs"" behind as the character moves. These devices interact with mesh inserts (or ectos) as long as they are within range (50 meters), allowing the user to map their position in relation to the breadcrumb trail. This is useful in derelict habitats, wilderness, and other areas where there is no local functioning mesh, and is helpful both for mapping and for finding one's way back."
GEAR|Electrogravitics Net|Survival Gear||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Moderate| Also called a safety net, this fail-safe system uses electric fields to counter gravity when falling. While the system is not able to actually levitate heavy objects, it will slow down a fall enough that the user can land safely if the gravitational force is not too high (the fall height is not greater than 50 meters in 1G). Generating these electric fields consumes a lot of energy, so the net is only charged for one use only and needs to be recharged afterwards.
GEAR|Electronic Rope|Survival Gear||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 332) The fibers in this rope can be controlled electronically, making it move in a snake-like fashion, stiffen up, and even wrap around objects.

GEAR|Emergency Bubble|Survival Gear||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Moderate|"(EP p. 332) Commonly used as a last resort ""life raft"" on spaceships, an emergency bubble is made of advanced smart materials and comes in a portable package that can be quickly inflated (1 Action Turn) around the user, usually inside an airlock. The bubble has a 5-meter diameter and can comfortably accommodate 4 people. It maintains 1 atmosphere of pressure in a vacuum, protect the inhabitants from temperatures ranging from -175 to 140 C, and provide light, breathable air and water and food recycling for up to four human-sized inhabitants, using its built in maker. It features a simple airlock, carries an emergency distress beacon (below), and can be transparent, opaque, or polarized. It is powered by a small nuclear battery and also includes comfortable inflatable furniture."
GEAR|Emergency Distress Beacon|Survival Gear||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Moderate|(EP p. 333) This small but powerful transmitter is powered by a nuclear battery and will broadcast any programmed distress call for years. Though portable and medium-sized, this beacon has a range of 500 km in urban areas and 5,000 km elsewhere.

GEAR|Nanobandage|Survival Gear||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Trivial|"(EP p. 333) Characters without medichines must rely on external sources of healing. The most common option is the nanobandage""a plum-sized advanced nanotechnology generator built into a reusable, self-sterilizing bandage. It can treat all forms of injury and illness, from poisoning to burns to trauma. Characters simply apply the bandage to the wound and let the nanobots do the work. It removes pain and discomfort and speeds healing. For especially severe injuries, physical first aid such as setting bones and removing projectiles may be necessary (gamemaster's choice). If the wounds are too severe (the patient has suffered more than five wounds), the unit places the patient in medical stasis and radios for emergency services."
GEAR|Repair Spray|Survival Gear||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 333) This nanobot generator creates nanobots designed to repair synthmorphs, vehicles, and other common objects. Repair spray contains the specifications and plans for almost all commonly used synthmorphs and devices and is a ubiquitous household item. If it does not contain the specifications for something it is being used to repair, it must query the object's voice for these details, otherwise it cannot repair it. Simply touch it to the damaged area, push the button on top, and it sprays out a number of nanobots sufficient to make repairs. These nanobots repair 1d10 points of damage per 2 hours. Once all damage is restored, the nanobots repair wounds at the rate of 1 per day. Repair spray also cleans and polishes items and returns them to a pristine and new state. Repair spray is not effective on any object with more than 3 wounds, but it provides a +30 to all repair rolls on anything too badly damaged for it to fully repair.
GEAR|Shelter Dome|Survival Gear||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Moderate|(EP p. 333) A variant of the emergency bubble, this package unfolds into a dome with a 2.5-meter ceiling and a floor 4 meters across. To safely use this shelter, it must be staked down to the surface it is placed on.
GEAR|Spindle|Survival Gear||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Moderate|(EP p. 333) A spindle is an advanced nanotechnology generator that produces a super-strong cable. It can produce up to 2 kilometers of 0.2 millimeter diameter line than can support up to 250 kilograms before it needs more raw materials. The spindle can produce up to 20 meters of cable every second. It can produce line in a continuous length or cut the cable it produces to any length. Spindles can also reabsorb their cable, retracting it at a rate of 5 m per second. As long as it is recharged and has small amounts of additional material added every 1,000 hours of use, a spindle can keep producing and retracting cable indefinitely. By setting the maximum production speed at 10 m/second a character with a spindle can safely jump off a building and land safely, using the cable to slow their descent.
GEAR|Spindle Climber|Survival Gear||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(EP p. 333) This device attaches to a spindle and transforms it into a highly effective climbing device. The spindle climber has two functions. First, it attaches hardened tips to the spindle's cable and fires it at high speed, up to 50 meters, with sufficient force to imbed the tip into almost any sufficiently durable surface. Second, the spindle climber can pull itself and up to 250 kg up the cable at a speed of up to 2 m/sec. A spindle climber has enough power to shoot and pull up the cable 50 times before it must be recharged. A spindle fits inside a spindle climber.

GEAR|High-dive suit|Armor,Survival Gear||||||13/10|FALSE|||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|High|" High-dive suits are individual spacesuits specifically designed to withstand atmospheric re-entry and allow the occupant to reach a planet's surface safely. They feature a liquid-cooled thermal regulation system, a closed-loop oxygen system with chemical scrubbers, small gas jets, a drogue chute, and a conventional parachute. High-dive suits are made of fullerene with a refractory metal coating and an opaque sapphire faceplate. A mini-oxygen tank and rebreather provide the wearer with 3 hours worth of breathing air. A high-dive suit compares to light body armor in terms of general protection, though its refractive glazing and heat-transfer systems provide extra protection against energy weapons (AV 13/10). Because of its thermal dampening systems, a high-dive suit also makes its wearer difficult to spot with thermal sensors (-30 modifier to Perception Tests), unless they are entering atmosphere, in which case they are difficult to miss (+30). Note that high-dive suits were designed for (unpow-ered) descent only""they are not equipped for any sort of powered flight."

Hard Suits look like large metallic ovals with jointed arms and legs. They are quite heavy, but the user can move relatively easily by using servo assist motors in all the major joints of the arms and legs. Unlike other vacsuits, they are solid and can resist both vacuum and up to 100 atmospheres of external pressure. Characters wearing hard suits can safely explore the upper atmosphere of a gas giant. They are well armored against punctures and radiation and possess miniature plasma thrusters capable of delivering 0.01G for 10 hours. A built-in high quality maker produces sufficient food, air, and water that a user can remain in a hard suit indefinitely. Explorers have used them continuously for up to 2 months. Their gloves incorporate smart materials that allow each hand to use the equivalent of a utilitool. Hard suits also contain radios and sensors equivalent to those on standard vacsuits. These suits have an Armor rating of 15/15, are maintained by a fixer nanohive, and are instantly self-sealing of any breach unless more than 30 points of damage are inflicted at once. They protect the wearer from temperatures of -200 to 180 C.

GEAR|Microlight|Vehicles|||||||||||||Low|(EP p. 310) This ultra-light personal aircraft is not much more than a strut-based wing, an airframe, and an electric propeller engine. They are ideal for getting around inside large habitats with enclosed airspace.
GEAR|Portable Plane|Vehicles|||||||||||||High|(EP p. 343) Powered by superconducting batteries and with an exceedingly small but powerful electric motor, this light but durable propeller plane is made of smart materials that allow it to be swiftly folded up into a small portable package. Different versions are designed for  flight on Mars, Titan, or Venus, each taking 10 minutes to assemble or disassemble. The Martian version unpacks into an airplane with a wingspan of 11 m with a top speed of 250 kph and a cruising speed of 220 kph and a range of 1,300 km. The Venusian version has a wingspan of 9 m, a top speed of 200 kph and a range of 1,000 km. The version designed for use on Titan has a wingspan of 8 m and has a top speed of 200 kph and a range of 2,000 km. In all versions, the two occupants ride in an inflatable and insulated pressurized bubble with a life support system capable of providing clean air and comfortable temperatures for 20 hours on Mars and Venus, and 15 hours on Titan.
GEAR|Rocket Buggy|Vehicles|||||||||||||Expensive|(EP p. 343) This vehicle is the most common form of medium to long distance personal transport on Luna, and is in common on most other moons and large asteroids. On these airless worlds, a rocket buggy can reach orbit and return or take a parabolic path to any destination on that moon in less than an hour. This vehicle is also regularly used to travel between habitats that are less than 30,000 km apart. The vehicle is pressurized, but is designed for short duration travel only. The seats are relatively small and the life support system contains no provisions for recycling food or water and can only support the passengers for an absolute maximum of 50 uncomfortable hours. Rockets buggies come equipped with headlights, radio boosters, and radar with a range of up to 250 km. A version of this vehicle is also used on both Mars and Titan, but here the frame has been modified to act as a lifting body, and it has a top speed in the thin Martian atmosphere of 2,500 km/hour and a range of 8,000 km on Mars. On Titan is has a top speed of 3,000 kph in the atmosphere, but it can also reach orbit.
GEAR|Small Jet|Vehicles|||||||||||||Expensive|(EP p. 343) Methane-powered jet planes are one of the most common forms of fast transport on Mars and Venus. Similar planes are used on Titan, except that they carry both liquid methane and liquid oxygen. These jets range in size from huge vehicles the size of late 20th-century airliners to small planes designed to carry half a dozen passengers. All jets are made using smart materials, so that their wings and frames can adapt to a wide range of speeds and altitudes. One common small jet has similar versions in use on Venus, Mars, and Titan, has a single jet engine and has a life support system capable of providing air for up to 100 hours. The Venusian and Martian versions both have a top speed of 900 kph, a wingspan of 11 m, and a maximum range of 5,000 km. The version designed for Titan has a wingspan of 8 m, a top speed of 650 kph, and a range of 4,000 km. Jets are equipped with headlights, radio boosters, and radar with a range of up to 250 km.
GEAR|Flying Car|Vehicles|||||||||||||Expensive|(SW p. 168) These highly-efficient, methane-powered, turbofan vectored-thrust vehicles are common on Mars, especially in the cities and larger settlements. The vehicle is the size of a small sedan, and the fans fold into the body when not in use, enabling it to also operate as a ground car. On the ground, they have a maximum velocity of 180 kph on roads, but only 60 kph off-road. Flying car cabins are pressurized, heated, equipped with radar and a radio booster, and provide life support for biomorphs unequipped to breath Martian atmosphere.

GEAR|Battle Suit*|Exoskeleton||||||18/18|TRUE||||||Expensive| The battle suit powered exoskeleton features a military-grade fullerene armor shell with flexible aerogel for thermal insulation and a diamond-hardened exterior designed to resist even potent ballistic and energy-based weapons. The suit also enhances the wearer's strength and mobility, applying a +10 bonus to strength-based tests, inflicting an extra +1d10 damage and AP of -2 on melee attacks, and doubling the distance by which the character may jump. Battlesuits are completely sealed to protect the wearer from environmental factors, and fitted with life support features and a maker capable of recycling all wastes and producing air for up to 48 hours and food and water indefinitely. Battle suits are equipped with each an ecto, a radio booster, and sensors equal to specs. These suits have an Armor Value of 18/18 (not cumulative with any other armor) and protect the wearer from temperatures from -175 to 140 C.
GEAR|Exowalker|Exoskeleton||||||2/4|FALSE||||||Moderate| Exowalkers are minimal framework exoskeletons, primarily designed to bolster the wearer's strength and movement.

GEAR|Cycle|Vehicles|||||||||||||Moderate|(EP p. 344) Because of the high cost of enclosing a habitat and providing life support, space is at a premium in all cities except some of the newest cities on Mars. As a result, there is rarely room for large roads or the cars that once carpeted the roads of Earthly cities. Instead, the ubiquitous modern vehicle is the cycle, which is designed to drive down narrow streets only a little wider than sidewalks in Earth cities. There are many different varieties of cycle. Some have only a single wheel and are gyro-stabilized, but most have two wheels and resemble old Earth motorcycles. In some, the driver and passenger are enclosed by a streamlined pod. These vehicles are powered by superconducting batteries, have a range of 600 km and a top speed of 120 kph, but must usually drive more slowly in crowded streets. Cycles are all equipped with radio boosters, headlights, and a por- table radar sensor. Tires are solid state (not inflated), or in some cases smart spokes capable of handling stairs. Some luxury versions have limited life-support in the small cabin, capable of providing air for the passengers for up to 10 hours.
GEAR|Mars Buggy|Vehicles|||||||||||||High|(EP p. 344) One of the most ubiquitous vehicles on Mars is the so-called Mars buggy, a four-wheeled vehicle with large balloon tires that is designed for use both on roads and on almost any terrain. Mars buggies can travel at speed of up to 110 kph on roads, 90 kph over relatively  at terrain, and up to 40 kph on jagged and rocky terrain. They can maintain these speeds because smart materials in both the suspension and the tires reshape themselves to adapt to uneven conditions and their nuclear batteries give them an effectively unlimited range. Most Mars buggies are enclosed but unpressurized. Similar vehicles are used on Luna and Titan, however, though the passenger compartments of these vehicles includes life support gear that provides the occupants with air for at least 100 hours. Buggies are powered by nuclear batteries and come in a variety of sizes, from small two-person buggies to large trucks. Mars buggies come equipped with headlights, radio boosters, and a vehicle radar system.

Biomorphs and pod morphs can only safely use this vehicle when wearing a vacuum suit or some garment that is similarly heat resistant. Also, to prevent harm to the wearer, the thrust must be kept sufficiently low that it can only take off on Mars or moons with even lower gravity. A rocket pack can keep the wearer airborne for up to 15 minutes in Mars gravity, or 30 minutes on Luna, Titan, or any of the four large Jovian moons. On Mars, it has a maximum speed of 700 kph. It can be used to reach orbit and land again on Luna, Titan, and other similarly small bodies like the Jovian moons. Rocket packs are equipped with radio boosters but no other sensors or communication devices.
GEAR|Thruster Pack|Vehicles|||||||||||||Low|(EP p. 345) Worn for EVA duties, this thruster pack uses vectored thrust nozzles, allowing a character to maneuver in open space. This is not a jetpack and does not produce enough thrust for atmospheric movement.
GEAR|Automech|Robot|||||||||||||Moderate|(EP p.345) T Automechs are general purpose repair drones, found just about everywhere. Each particular automech tends to specialize in a particular type of repair work and so carries the appropriate tools and AI skills, whether it be habitat waste recyclers, outer hull integrity, or servitor systems. Standard automechs are wheeled cubes with articulated limbs, though they are also equipped with vectored-thrust drives for zero-G work.
GEAR|Creepy|Robot|||||||||||||Low|(EP p. 345) Creepies are small crawler bots that come in an eclectic variety of shapes and forms, from robosquirrels to insectoids to bizarre and artsy mechanical creatures. Creepies were originally designed as a sort of robotic pet, but they are commonly used as a general purpose household minion, like a more beloved servitor. Many people in fact wear a creepy on their person, dropping it to handle small tasks for them and letting it crawl up and down and over their body.
GEAR|Dr. Bot|Robot|||||||||||||Moderate|(EP p. 345) These wheeled medical robots are designed to tend to and transport injured or sick people. They carry a healing vat, a specialized pharmaceuticals maker, miscellaneous medical gear, and articulated arms for conducting remote surgery.
GEAR|Dwarf|Robot|||||||||||||Expensive|"(EP p. 345) These large industrial bots are named not just for their primary use""mining, excavation, tunneling, and construction""but because the default AIs they shipped with had a programmed tendency to happily whistle as they worked. Dwarfs are quadrapedal walkers, equipped with massive modular industrial tools like boring drills, shovels, hydraulic jacks, jackhammers, scooping arms, acid sprays, and so on."
GEAR|Gnat|Robot|||||||||||||Low|(EP p. 345) Gnats are small rotorcraft camera/surveillance drones. Many people use gnats for personal lifelogging, while socialites and media use them to capture the glamor or hottest news.
GEAR|Guardian Angel|Robot|||||||||||||Moderate|(EP p. 345) Similar to gnats, guardian angel rotorcraft hover around their charges, keeping a watchful eye out to protect them from threats.
GEAR|Saucer|Robot|||||||||||||Low|"(EP p. 345) These disc-shaped drones are lightweight and quiet. They are typically launched by throwing them like a frisbee, after which they propel themselves with an ionic drive. Saucers make excellent ""eye in the sky"" monitors and scouts."
GEAR|Servitor|Robot|||||||||||||Low|"(EP p. 346) Servitors are the most common robot, acting as cooks, janitors, universal helpers, movers, and personal aides. Every home has one, if not several. Servitors are intentionally built in non-humanoid forms so as not to confuse them with common synthmorphs and in order to defuse bad feelings at ordering them around. However, they all have some form of ""face"" to interact with, so as not to be too machine-like."
GEAR|Speck|Robot|||||||||||||Low|"(EP p. 346) Specks are tiny insectoid spy drones, 2.5 mm long and 2 mm wide, about the size of a small fruit fly. They fly with tiny wings, carry a microbug, and are excellent for surveillance purposes or otherwise being a ""speck on a wall."" Specks are difficult to notice (-30 Perception modifier) and almost impossible to distinguish from an actual insect."

GEAR|Armor Vest|Armor||||||6/6|FALSE||||||Low| Armor vests provide more thorough protection to a body's vital areas, covering the abdomen and torso completely, protecting the neck with a rigid collar, and even providing wrap-under protection for the groin. Though armor vests are not bulky, they are obvious as armor. Armor vests may be worn with armor clothing without penalty. Armor vests provide an Armor Value of 6/6.
GEAR|Body Armor (Light)|Armor||||||10/10|FALSE||||||Low| These high performance armor outfits protect the wearer from head to toe. An integrated armor vest is supplemented with increased protection on the limbs and joints, while still managing to be flexible and non-restrictive. Body armor is typically worn by security and police forces, and supplemented with a helmet. It provides an Armor Value of 10/10.
GEAR|Body Armor (Heavy)|Armor||||||13/13|FALSE||||||Moderate| Similar to light body armor, but with extra protective layers, often ergonomically manufactured to conform to a specific character's body, and an environmental seal with climate control to protect the wearer from hostile environments. It provides an Armor Value of 13/13.
GEAR|Crash Suit|Armor||||||4/6|FALSE||||||Low| Designed for both industrial worksite safety and protection from accidental zero-G collisions, crash suits are also favored by sports enthusiasts and explorers. The basic jumpsuit offers comfortable protection equal to that of armor clothing. When activated with an electronic signal, however, elastic polymers within the suit stiffen and form rigid impact protection for vital areas. Crash suits provide an Armor Value of 3/4 when inactive and 4/6 when activated.
GEAR|Light Helmet|Armor||||||2/2|FALSE||||||Trivial| This armor accessory is usually worn with body armor or a battle suit. Light helmets are open, whereas full helmets latch on and provide an environmental seal with a 12 hour supply of air. Light helmets provide an Armor Value bonus of +2/+2, whereas full helmets add +3/+3. Helmets are often equipped with an ecto, a radio booster, and sensors equal to specs.
GEAR|Full Helmet|Armor||||||3/3|FALSE||||||Trivial| This armor accessory is usually worn with body armor or a battle suit. Light helmets are open, whereas full helmets latch on and provide an environmental seal with a 12 hour supply of air. Light helmets provide an Armor Value bonus of +2/+2, whereas full helmets add +3/+3. Helmets are often equipped with an ecto, a radio booster, and sensors equal to specs.
GEAR|Riot Shield|Armor||||||3/2|FALSE||||||Low| Used for mob suppression, riots shields are light-weight, tough, and may be set to electrify on command, stunning anyone who comes into contact with the outer surface (treat as shock glove effects). Riot shields provide an Armor Value bonus of +3/+2.
GEAR|Second Skin|Armor||||||1/3|FALSE||||||Low| This lightweight bodysuit, woven from spider silks and fullerenes, is typically worn as an underlayer, though some athletes use it as a uniform. It provides minimal protection, but may be worn with other armor without penalty. It provides an Armor Value of 1/3.
GEAR|Smart Skin|Armor||||||3/2|FALSE||||||Low|Smart skin is an advanced nanofluid that covers the wearer's skin. It resembles liquid mercury but retains the texture and flexibility of normal skin until activated, at which point the material becomes rigid enough to protect the wearer and distribute the kinetic energy (though still flexible enough at the joints not to impede movement). A specialized hive, worn by the character, replenishes the nanobots and stores them when not in use. Deploying the nanobots across the body takes a full Action Turn. Smart skin has an Armor Value of 3/2, and may be worn with other armor without penalty.
GEAR|Spray Armor|Armor||||||2/2|FALSE||||||Low| This fast armor application comes in a spray can and disperses a smart chemical polymer that sticks to bare flesh (but does not adhere to hair and eyes). The polymer solidifies into a form fitting body armor fabric when exposed to body temperature with the look and feel of a latex suit. Spray armor does not work on synthetic morphs or on clothing or other armor. The color and feel of the armor can be adjusted with electric currents and additional polymers, making it popular among some socialite and nightlife scenes. The spray-on armor does not wash off, but degrades 1 point of armor (both energy and kinetic) every 12 hours. It may be removed with a special nanotech solvent. Spray armor has an Armor Value of 2/2.
||||||||||||||||
GEAR|Ablative Patches|Armor Mod|||||||||||||Trivial| These thin and light slap-on patches of stick to armor and are designed to absorb heat and energy from beams and explosions, safely vaporizing and blowing hot gas away. Ablative patches increases the Armor Value by +4/+2, but each hit reduces both the energy and kinetic value of the ablative armor by 1.
GEAR|Chameleon Coating|Armor Mod|||||||||||||Trivial| This provides the armor with the same effect as the chameleon cloak.
GEAR|Fireproofing|Armor Mod|||||||||||||Trivial| Fireproofing includes the addition of heat-resistant ceramic or fire-resistant layers, both capable of withstanding extremely high temperatures. Fireproofing increases the Armor Value by +2/+0, and provides an additional 10 points of armor against heat or fire specifically.
GEAR|Immunogenic System|Armor Mod|||||||||||||Low| The immunogenic mod adds an active nanobot swarm, maintained by a specialized hive, that coats the outer layer of armor and also the non-armored parts of the wearer's morph. It acts as an outer immune system designed to neutralize toxic agents and nanotoxins with which it comes into contact. This provides immunity to drugs, toxins, and nanotoxins applied dermally, such as with a slap patch or splash grenade. It has no effect on inhaled, oral, or injected drugs (including coated weapons).
GEAR|Lotus Coating|Armor Mod|||||||||||||Trivial|The armor has been impregnated with a superhydrophic coating (contact angle of around 170) that repels all water-like liquids. If the armor is splashed by liquid toxins or chemicals, the effect is reduced since the liquids starts to roll off the armor. Apply a +30 modifier when defending against liquid-based attacks.
GEAR|Offensive Armor|Armor Mod|||||||||||||Low| When activated, the outer layer of this armor is rigged to shock anyone or anything that contacts it with electricity. Treat its DV and effect as a shock baton.
GEAR|Reactive Coating|Armor Mod|||||||||||||Moderate| A thick layer of advanced nanotech is applied to the armor, protecting it with a colony of nanobots designed to sense incoming attacks. When an attack strikes the coating, it detonates to disrupt the attack. Bursts and full autofire are treated as a single attack. A reactive coating increases the Armor Value by +5/+5, but each detonation automatically inflicts 1 point of damage on the wearer. Reactive armor also works against melee attacks, but the attacker also suffers 1d10 / 2 (round up) points of damage per attack (armor protects) from the microexplosion. Reactive coating only works against 5 attacks, after which the specialized nanobot hive replenishes the coating at the rate of 1 use per hour.
GEAR|Refractive Glazing|Armor Mod|||||||||||||Low| A combination of reflectors, refractive metamaterials, and an energy transfer system with heat radiators provides extra protection against energy weapons. Increase the Armor Value by +3/+0.
GEAR|Self-Healing|Armor Mod|||||||||||||Moderate| The armor is equipped with a nanohive that acts like repair spray.
GEAR|Shock Proof|Armor Mod|||||||||||||Low| Shock proof armor is electronically insulated to discharge and reduce the effect of shock weapons. Apply an additional +10 modifier when resisting the DV and effects of shock weapons.
GEAR|Thermal Dampening|Armor Mod|||||||||||||Moderate| Thermal dampening obfuscates heat signatures by converting body heat into electric energy. It makes the target more difficult to spot with thermal sensors; apply a -30 modifier for Perception Tests.
||||||||||||||||
GEAR|Armor-Piercing|Ammo|-5|-2|||||||||||Low| This tungsten-carbide ammunition penetrates armor effectively.
GEAR|Bug|Ammo|1|-1d10|||||||||||Low| Bug rounds are equipped with a microbug and medical sensor nanobots. They attempt to gather information on the target's location (via standard mesh tracking), health (querying the target's medichines), and surroundings (typically hindered by being inside the target's body). They will transmit status reports in a pre-programmed manner via the mesh or a pre-chosen frequency band either continuously or in pre-set intervals.
GEAR|Capsule|Ammo|1|-half|||||||||||Trivial plus payload cost| Capsule ammo carries a payload (drug, toxin, nanobots) that is released inside the target after the round penetrates.
GEAR|Flux|Ammo|as ammo type|as ammo type|||||||||||Low|" Flux ammo is made from rheological materials that allow each bullet to be ""programmed"" so that they may change from regular rounds to less-lethal soft plastic-like rounds. This allows the firer to choose the type of round (regular or plastic) made with each shot or burst, and then change with the next one."
GEAR|Hollow-Point|Ammo|2|+1d10|||||||||||Trivial| Hollow-point bullets are designed to deform and widen once they penetrate a target, thus inflicting more damage.
GEAR|Jammer|Ammo|--|no damage|||||||||||Low| Jammers stick to the target and pulse out jamming electromagnetic signals, jamming the target's wireless communications. If an Opposed Test is called for, these devices have an Interface of 30.
GEAR|Plastic|Ammo|double|-half|||||||||||Trivial| Plastic ammo is designed to hurt but not wound targets, and is commonly used for crowd control purposes.
GEAR|Reactive|Ammo|-2|2|||||||||||Low|" The casing on these projectiles is made of reactive materials that release a large amount of energy when subjected to a sudden shock or impact""such as striking a target. In other words, they explode or superheat when they hit."
GEAR|Reactive Armor-Piercing (RAP)|Ammo|-6|-1|||||||||||Moderate| This is a tungsten-carbide armor-piercing round with a reactive casing, allowing the ammunition to penetrate even further.
GEAR|Regular Ammo|Ammo|--|--|||||||||||Trivial| This standard metal projectile is designed to put holes into morphs.
GEAR|Splash|Ammo|--|No damage|||||||||||Trivial plus payload cost| Splash rounds carry a payload like capsule ammo, but are designed to break upon impact rather than penetrating, splashing their contents on the target's exterior. Splash rounds are typically loaded with paint, taggant nanobots, tracker dye, and similar substances.
GEAR|Zap|Ammo|2|-half+shock|||||||||||Trivial| Zap rounds are rubber or gel bullets that create an electric charge upon firing in a piezoelectric like manner to stun the target effectively with both the bullet and the electric shock.
GEAR|Accushot|Ammo|--|--|||||||||||Low| Accushot bullets change shape within flight to keep dead on course, countering the effects of wind, drag, and gravity over distance. Attacks made with accushot bullets ignore all range modifiers.
GEAR|Biter|Ammo|--|+1d10|||||||||||Low| Biters are specially-designed to fragment in opposite proportion to the hardness of the target they strike. For hard targets (synthmorphs), they fragment very little, blasting a big hole. For soft targets (biomorphs), they fragment and tumble in multiple directions within the body.
GEAR|Flayer|Ammo|--|2|||||||||||Low| Flayers have nanosensors to detect an oncoming impact, shooting out monomolecular barbs as they are about to strike a target. These monowires cut through the target along with the bullet, inflicting additional damage.
GEAR|Homing|Ammo|--|--|||||||||||Low|When fired with a smartlink system, the bullet identifies the target and uses nanosensors to lock on, correcting the bullet's trajectory with surface alterations and tiny vectored nozzles. Apply a +10 modifier to the Attack Test, cumulative with aiming and smartlink modifiers. Homing bullets may also be used for indirect fire.
GEAR|Laser-Guided|Ammo|--|--|||||||||||Low| These bullets function like homing smart rounds (apply the +10 attack modifier), except rather than requiring a smartlink system, they lock onto the reflection of the laser sight used to paint the target. Laser-guided bullets may also be used for indirect fire.
GEAR|Proximity|Ammo|-1|2|||||||||||Moderate| Proximity is an explosive ammunition that identifies the target when fired via smartlink. If the round determines that it will miss the target, it will still explode if it reaches the close proximity of the target. If the attack misses with an MoF of 10 or less, the round explodes 1d10 meters away from the target and inflicts 1d10 area effect damage in the proximity of the target.
GEAR|Zero|Ammo|--|--|||||||||||Low|" Similar to homing smart rounds, zero bullets identify the target when fired via smartlink. Whether the round hits or misses, however, it sends telemetry data back to the next zero bullet, allowing it to course-correct and ""zero in"" to hit the target (or hit more accurately). Apply a +10 modifier to each shot (or burst) fired after the first against the same target in the same Action Turn."
||||||||||||||||
GEAR|Concussion|Weapon,Ammo,Seeker/Grenade|--|1d10/2|||||||||||Moderate| These devices emit a concussive blast designed to knock opponents off their feet and stun them. Any character caught within a base blast radius of 10 meters must make a SOM x 2 Test. If they fail, they are knocked down. If their MoF is 30+, they are additionally stunned until the end of the next Action Turn. Anyone caught in the blast radius suffers a -10 action modifier for the rest of that Action Turn.
GEAR|EMP|Weapon,Ammo,Seeker/Grenade|--|--|||||||||||High|"EMP munitions fire off a strong electromagnetic pulse when they ""detonate."" Since most electronics in Eclipse Phase are built with optical technology, and power supplies and sensitive microcircuits are shielded and surge-protected, this has no major damaging effect. Antennas, however, are vulnerable, especially finer wires like those used with mesh inserts. As a result, the primary effect of EMP is to disable radio communications""every radio within range of the blast is reduced to 1/10th the normal range. The base blast radius for EMP is 50 meters."
GEAR|Frag|Weapon,Ammo,Seeker/Grenade|-4|3d10+6|||||||||||Moderate| Fragmentation explosives spread a cloud of lethal flechettes over the area of effect. They are resisted with kinetic armor.
GEAR|Gas/Smoke|Weapon,Ammo,Seeker/Grenade|--|--|||||||||||Low| Gas/smoke munitions emit a cloud of their contained substance. Smoke impedes sight by releasing thick fumes upon ignition of the seeker. The smoke can be of any color and is often heated (called thermal smoke) to obfuscate heat signatures moving through the smoke as cover. Note that gases dissipate much more quickly under certain environmental conditions (wind, rain, etc.)
GEAR|High-Explosive|Weapon,Ammo,Seeker/Grenade|--|3d10+10|||||||||||Moderate| High-explosive seekers and grenades are designed to create a very destructive shock and heat wave. This damage is resisted with energy armor.
GEAR|High-Explosive Armor-Piercing (HEAP)|Weapon,Ammo,Seeker/Grenade|-8|3d10+12|||||||||||Moderate| A design only available for seekers (not grenades), HEAP warheads use high explosives to blast a path for a penetrating round. HEAPs lose -4 damage per meter distance from the blast, as opposed to the usual -2.
GEAR|Overload|Weapon,Ammo,Seeker/Grenade|AVx2|1d10/2|||||||||||Moderate|"Overload grenades and seekers launch an all-out assault on the target's sensory spectrum. This attack includes blinding by intense flashing light, a deafening thunderclap followed by intense ultrasonic screaming, nausea-inducing malodorants, and infra-sonic frequencies that can trigger unpleasant emotional responses (anxiety, uneasiness, extreme sorrow, nervous feelings of revulsion or fear). For an extra kick, overloads are also packed with ""stingballs""""rubber pellets that inflict pain when detonated near an under-armored target. Anyone caught in the base 10-meter blast radius must make a SOM + WIL Test. If they fail, they must immediately leave the area of effect. If they fail with an MoF of 30+, they are incapacitated for 3 Action Turns with disorientation and/or vomiting, after which they must roll again. Overload munitions remain in effect for 1 full minute. Anyone in the area of effect suffers a -30 action modifier, which reduces by 10 per Action Turn after they leave the area. Additionally, anyone facing the direction of the overload round suffers a -10 glare modifier (neutralized by anti-glare systems)."
GEAR|Plasmaburst|Weapon,Ammo,Seeker/Grenade|-6|3d10+10|||||||||||High|" Also called ""hellballs,"" these munitions release a burst of plasma upon detonation that causes searing heat and fire damage across the area of effect without the devastating shockwaves of explosions that might rebound in an enclosed environment and/or breach a habitat's infrastructure."
GEAR|Splash|Weapon,Ammo,Seeker/Grenade|--|--|||||||||||Low plus payload cost| Splash rounds spread a contained substance (drug, chemical, nanoswarm, paint) over a base 10-meter blast radius when they detonate.
GEAR|Thermobaric|Weapon,Ammo,Seeker/Grenade|-10|3d10+5|||||||||||High| Thermobaric grenades and seekers utilize a more deadly form of explosion. When they detonate, they disperse a cloud of aerosol explosive over an area and then ignite, literally setting the air on fire, generating a devastating pressure wave, and sucking the oxygen out of the area. Thermobarics use the rules for uniform blast.
GEAR|Sticky grenades|Grenade Mod|||||||||||||Trivial|Sticky grenades have a special coating that when triggered becomes a sticky adhesive, allowing the grenade to be stuck to almost any surface. Sticky grenades can even be wielded in melee combat, smacking them on an opponent to be detonated later.
||||||||||||||||
GEAR|Arm Slide|Weapon Accessory|||||||||||||Low| This slide-mount can hold a pistol-sized weapon under a character's sleeve, pushing the weapon into the character's hand with an electronic signal or specific sequence of arm movements.
GEAR|Extended Magazine|Weapon Accessory|||||||||||||Low| This ammunition case has an increased capacity. Increase the weapon's ammo capacity by +50%. Only available for firearms and seekers.
GEAR|Gyromount|Weapon Accessory|||||||||||||Moderate| This weapon harness features a gyrostabilized weapon mount that keeps the weapon steady. Negates all modifiers from movement.
GEAR|Imaging Scope|Weapon Accessory|||||||||||||Low| Imaging scopes attach to the top of the weapon and act like specs. Scopes may also bend like a periscope, along a character to point the weapon and target around corners without leaving cover.
GEAR|Flash Suppressor|Weapon Accessory|||||||||||||Low| This device obscures the muzzle flash on firearms, applying a -10 modifier on Perception Tests to locate a  ring weapon by its flash.
GEAR|Laser Sight|Weapon Accessory|||||||||||||Low|This underbarrel laser emits a beam that places a glowing red dot on the target to assist targeting. Apply a +10 modifier to Attack Tests (not cumulative with a smartlink modifier). Laser sights may also be used to paint a target for laser-guided smart ammo or seekers. Infrared and ultraviolet lasers are also available, so that the dot is only visible to characters able to see in those spectrums.
GEAR|Safety System|Weapon Accessory|||||||||||||Low| A biometric (palmprint or voiceprint) or ego ID sensor is embedded in the weapon, disabling it if anyone other than an authorized user attempts to fire it.
GEAR|Shock Safety|Weapon Accessory|||||||||||||Moderate| Just like a safety system, except that an unauthorized user is zapped with an electric shock. Treat as a shock baton.
GEAR|Silencer/Sound Suppressor|Weapon Accessory|||||||||||||Moderate| This barrel-mounted accessory reduces the sound of a firearm's discharge. Apply a -10 modifier on hearing-based Perception Tests to hear or locate the gun's firing.
GEAR|Smartlink|Weapon Accessory|||||||||||||Moderate| A smartlink system connects the weapon to the user's mesh inserts, placing a targeting bracket in the character's field of vision and providing range and targeting information. Apply a +10 modifier to the Attack Test. Smartlinks also incorporate a microcamera that allows the user to see what the weapon is pointed at, fire around corners, etc. Smartlinks also allow certain other types of weapon system control, such as changing flux ammo or programming seeker trigger conditions.
GEAR|Smart Magazine|Weapon Accessory|||||||||||||Moderate| A smart magazine allows the character to pick and choose what ammo round will be fired with each shot. This system leaves less room for bullets, however, so reduce the weapon's ammunition capacity by half (round up). Smart magazines may be combined with extended magazines, in which case ammo capacity is normal.

GEAR|Implanted Nanotoxin: Schizo|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Moderate|(EP p. 308) An implanted nanobot hive that produces and grants immunity to Schizo that can be deployed via a scratch, saliva, or skin contact.
GEAR|Weapon Mount: Concealed|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph|Moderate|(EP p. 311) The Morph carries a built-in weapon. It has a fixed field of fire because of its concealed mount. It receives a -30 to Perception Tests to detect.
GEAR|Weapon Mount: Fixed|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph|Low|(EP p. 311) The Morph carries a built-on weapon. It has a fixed field of fire from its fixed mount.
GEAR|Weapon Mount: Swiveling|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph|Low|(EP p. 311) The Morph carries a built-on weapon. It has a limited field of fire from its swiveling mount.
GEAR|Weapon Mount: Articulated|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph|Moderate|(EP p. 311) The Morph carries a built-on weapon. It has an wide field of fire from its articulated mount.
GEAR|High Gravity Adaptation|Augmentation||||||||5||5:SOM||Biomorph,Pod,Uplift|Moderate|(GC p. 154) This augmentation is specifically designed to allow a morph to operate in environments where gravity is significantly greater than Earth's. The morph's heart and circulatory system are strengthened and its skeleton altered in composition and proportion to be harder, slightly thicker, and considerably more durable. The morph's muscle density is also increased and tendons and ligaments bolstered for improved efficiency in higher gravity. Apply a +5 Durability and +5 SOM bonus. In addition, the character suffers no negative modifiers from gravities up to 2 g, and reduces all penalties for higher gravities by 1 g.
GEAR|Hearing Filter|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(PO p. 149) With this implant morphs can fine tune the information provided by the bioware Enhanced Hearing as if it was the Cyberware version. 
GEAR|Smell Filter|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(PO p. 149) With this implant morphs can fine tune the information provided by the bioware Enhanced Smell as if it was the Cyberware version. 
GEAR|Vision Filter|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(PO p. 149) With this implant morphs can fine tune the information provided by the bioware Enhanced Vision as if it was the Cyberware version.
GEAR|Smart Wings|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph|Low|(RW p. 186) This augmentation consists of a smart material coating on the morph's arms. With a Quick Action, the synthmorph can extend or retract smart-material wings with a wingspan of 8 meters. In normal atmospheric pressure, the synthmorph can fly at speeds of up to 100 kph as long as the surface gravity is less than 0.15 g. They may also be used for gliding (see Gliding Membranes, p. 166, Sunward). When retracted, this augmentation is hidden. This mod is very common for synthmorphs on Titan and in various large low gravity habitats throughout the outer system. Large or heavy morphs may not use it.
GEAR|Cryonic Protection|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph|Low|(RW p. 186) Even synthmorphs can have difficulty with the cryonic temperatures found in the outer system. While almost any synthmorph can operate normally for at least an hour at these temperatures, longer exposure can cause materials to get brittle and joints to lock up, especially in an atmosphere thick enough to conduct heat away from the morph. This augmentation uses the morph's nuclear battery to slightly warm its surface, while also coating the morph with a thin layer of insulation. Cryonic protection allows synthmorphs to operate indefinitely in the coldest temperatures found in the solar system.
GEAR|Ego Sharing|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph|Expensive|(RW p. 186) This enhancement allows more than one ego to access the internal systems and controlling functions of a single synthmorph, bot, or vehicle at one time. Each ego requires its own cyberbrain. Command responsibilities are usually divided into appropriate sectors of control. For example, one ego is responsible for physical movement, another handles data analysis, a third operates weapon controls, and so on. Each ego acts on its own Initiative; the morph may only move on one ego's action and each weapon system and enhancement may only be actively used by one ego per Combat Turn, though other egos may passively access data from enhancements and systems used by others. Morph aptitude modifiers and bonuses from enhancements apply to all egos equally. No Speed-boosting enhancements may be used with this morph.
GEAR|Hydrostatic Pressure Adaptation|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Expensive|(RW p. 188) The morph is capable of operating under extreme pressure conditions. Biomorphs (including pods) with this mod can withstand up to 500 atmospheres; the synthmorph equivalent can handle up to 2,500 atmospheres. The morph can also acclimate to changing pressures more quickly and is immune to oxygen toxicity, nitrogen narcosis, and the bends.
GEAR|Neural Enhancers|Augmentation||||||||||5:COG||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Expensive|(RW p. 189) This active nanotechnology bonds with the morph's neural structures, creating a series of specialized cognitive subprocessors that enhance the user's intelligence. It provides users with a +5 modifier to COG. However, enhancing intelligence is a difficult process and this enhancement is based on techniques used on existing morphs. It has no effect if used on a morph that has a COG modifier of +10 or more. This augmentation can be used on biomorphs, pods, and synthmorphs.
GEAR|Parallel Processor|Augmentation||||||||||5:COG,-1:TT||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift,Eidolon|High|(RW p. 189) A modified derivative of the neo-syngergist hypermesh link, this augmentation allows users to link their minds together together in a manner similar to parallel processing computers, allowing them to borrow processing power from other linked egos to solve intellectual problems. In addition to automatically providing the appropriate teamwork bonus for the problem (to a maximum of +30) without the others needing to take any actions, as long as three or more users are linked together, each user also gains a +5 COG bonus for the duration of the linkage. These bonuses only apply when the users are linked. Users must possess the mental speed augmentation to use this implant. While the implant is active, the character's Trauma Threshold is reduced by 1. To avoid possible personality bleed-over, users are advised to use this augmentation for no more than six hours per day.
GEAR|Temperature Tolerance: Cryonic|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Pod,Uplift|High|(RW p. 189) The morph is treated as having the Temperature Tolerance bioware (p. 305, EP), but the addition of both an integral nuclear battery and specially bioformed insulation allows this morph to indefinitely tolerate temperatures as low as -200 C without harm as long as the morph is in an atmosphere with a pressure of less than 0.1 atmosphere. In a dense atmosphere, like that of Titan, the morph can endure temperatures as low as -120 C.
GEAR|Plasma Sail Implant|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Expensive|(RW p. 189) This augmentation installs a miniature plasma sail in the morph. This implant includes a potent batterypowered superconducting magnet and a tank holding sufficient compressed hydrogen to allow the plasma sail to operate for three months. This implant allows the user to fly through space with an acceleration of up to 0.01 g, though beyond the orbit of Saturn the solar wind becomes too faint to provide any acceleration. In open space, this sail can achieve a maximum velocity of 80 kilometers per second, but can only be used to accelerate away from the sun (tacking can be used to sail toward the sun, but at a maximum of 10 kps). It can be used to maneuver in any direction, however, as long as the user is within a planet's strong magnetic field. Within 70,000 km of Earth, 3,000,000 km of Jupiter, 1,500,000 km of Saturn, 450,000 km of Uranus, or 500,000 km from Neptune, the plasma sail allows the user to maneuver freely and to land on and take off from any moon with a surface gravity of less than 0.05 g. Using it requires Flight skill. This is a relatively large implant and produces a characteristic humpback shape on almost all morphs.
GEAR|Radiation Tolerance|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Pod,Uplift|Expensive|(RW p. 189) This mod may only be installed in morphs with medichines. The biomorph's DNA is redundantly encoded and vital tissues are actively replaced. Additionally, vital systems are protected with special shielding sleeves and blood filters, and many chemical processes are reinforced against disruption. The morph can survive radiation exposure thirty times as effectively as if unaugmented.
GEAR|Winterist|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(RW p. 189) The character has the androgynous appearance and non-sexual erogenous zones common to inhabitants of Winter hab (p. 64). The character has a monthly hormonal cycle driving their desire for erogenous contact. The character also produces fertile gametes once a month in accordance with this cycle, but these must be harvested through a medical procedure and placed in a Winterist exowomb in order to be fertilized. This augmentation can be added to any biomorph but may not be taken in combination with the sex switch augmentation or any other augmentation directly linked to the character's sex. Characters with this augmentation are immune to the effects of tailored pheromones.
GEAR|Long Term Life Support|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Expensive|(RW p. 189) The biomorph is adapted for harsh environmental conditions and can survive for long periods of time as a closed system thanks to symbiotic bacteria and nanomachines. This augmentation allows any biomorph or pod to recycle air, food, and water for up to one year. This augmentation's implanted miniature maker allows the morph to process ice and various simple organic chemicals into air, water, and food. The morph need not eat or breathe but must ingest about five kilograms of ice and carbon grit per day. It must also balance out or replenish chemical reserves once a month, either by exchanging with other similarly augmented morphs or applying a Low-cost chemical reserve pack.
GEAR|Temperature Tolerance: Cold|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Pod,Uplift|Moderate|(SW p. 166) The morph is treated as having the Temperature Tolerance biomod (p. 305, EP), but with an even greater resistance to low temperatures. The morph can tolerate temperatures as low as -80 C without ill effects.
GEAR|Digital Veil|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph,Pod,Eidolon|Expensive|(TH p. 139) This code masks the presence of any installed plug-ins and upgrades (including itself). The character must choose which are hidden (any installed after the veil is installed are not hidden unless the veil is re-installed). Anyone attempting a standard scan on the infomorph for plug-ins and upgrades (p. 148) will fail to detect the concealed software. At the gamemaster's discretion, an Excellent Success on the scan may pick up an anomaly to warrant deeper analysis. A more thorough and lengthy scan (an Infosec or Programming Task Action with a -30 modifier and a base time of 60 minutes) will reveal the presence of 1 plug-in or upgrade, plus 1 per 10 points of MoS. This plug-in also applies a -20 modifier to psych scans (p. 148) performed on the infomorph. It is illegal in many habitats and polities.
GEAR|Copylock|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph,Pod,Eidolon|Low|(TH p. 139) This plug-in has two uses. The first prevents an infomorph from voluntarily copying/forking itself. This also prevents the ego from resleeving into a physical morph. This is a common plug-in used on forks, indentures, or people that really don't trust themselves. This feature can be disabled with the proper passcode used by the installer. The second use is to make it more difficult for an active infomorph to be involuntarily copied. This is a common precaution infomorphs take when running on untrusted devices against the threat of forknapping (p. 149). Anyone that brainhacks this infomorph and attempts to make an involuntary copy suffers a -30 penalty to the Infosec Test needed to accomplish this task (in addition to the normal -30 modifier for brainhacking). Either of these features can be disabled with the proper passcode used by the installer.
GEAR|Autodelete|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph,Pod,Eidolon|Low|(TH p. 139) Though infomorphs can voluntarily delete themselves, there are some cases where a device's permissions may not allow it or the infomorph may be trapped on a lockbox (p. 146). To prevent capture, interrogation, or slavery, the infomorph can activate the autodelete plug-in as a Quick Action, which then attempts to delete the ego, even if it is running on a device that would not ordinarily permit it to do so. Auto-delete plug-ins may also be programmed to activate in response to certain inputs: for example, a perceived code phrase, a detected cyberbrain hack attack attempt, a designated time period, or upon failure to receive a periodic message. To successfully delete the ego on a system where deletion privileges are denied, the installer of the plug-in must make a successful Infosec Test. If the system is actively monitored, this is a Variable Opposed Infosec Test against the monitor. If only the installer succeeds, the infomorph is deleted immediately. If both the installer and monitor succeed, the infomorph is corrupted but not fully deleted. At the gamemaster's discretion, the ego may still be treated as a gamma fork or its digital remains prodded and analyzed via Psychosurgery with a -30 modifier. If the monitor alone succeeds, the auto-deletion fails and will not work again on that device. If both fail, continue to make the test again each Action Phase until one or both succeed. Forknappers and interrogators routinely check their victims for this plug-in (p. 148), so it is usually concealed with a digital veil (below). A detected plug-in may be eliminated via standard brainhacking (p. 148). This plug-in is commonly used on forks-often without their knowledge. Some polities, in fact, legally require forks to be equipped with this plug-in.
GEAR|Active Countermeasures|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph,Pod,Eidolon|High|(TH p. 140) This code helps an infomorph resist brainhacking (p. 148) by installing additional firewalls and layers of security applications within the infomorph's digital mind. The infomorph (or anything else serve as active security for its mind-state) receives a +10 modifier on attempts to zero in on spotted intruders (p. 257, EP). Defensive Mode: The countermeasures may also be triggered into a more secure defensive mode with a Quick Action. While defensive mode is activated, the infomorph and its active security receive a +10 modifier on attempts to lockout intruders (p. 258, EP) or resist entrapment, puppeteering, or scorching (p. 261, EP). The defenses provided by this mode are sufficiently intensive, however, that they cause minor delays to any mesh actions undertaken by the user. As a result, the infomorph suffers a -1 reduction to Initiative.
GEAR|Emergency Backup|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph,Pod,Eidolon|Moderate|(TH p. 140) This plug-in automatically broadcasts a copy of the infomorph's ego through the mesh to a predetermined secure storage site every 48 hours. This interval may be voluntarily modified, keeping in mind that ego broadcasts tend to be intentionally limited as a precaution against interception/forknapping and that such transmissions hog bandwidth. To use this upgrade, characters must either purchase backup insurance or arrange for a private server to store the backup copies of their ego. To prevent ego theft, the backup copies are transmitted using quantum cryptography (p. 254, EP). To intercept and make use of an ego backup sent in this fashion, the would-be thief must somehow gain access to one of the quantum keys used in the exchange.
GEAR|Hacking Alert|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph,Pod,Eidolon|Low|(TH p. 140) This plug-in launches a suite of running processes running that monitor the simulated mind-state and keep track of any lost time, inconsistencies in events, or other evidence of involuntary brainhacking or psychosurgery. If the character is mind hacked or subjected to involuntary psychosurgery, the hidden/ covert intruder or psychosurgeon must make an Infosec or Psychosurgery Test at -30. Cyberbrain hackers suffer the usual -30 subversion modifier, but a hidden intruder receives their standard +30 bonus. If the test does not score an Excellent Success (MoS 30+), the victim is alerted immediately (or when they next awake). Alerted infomorphs do not receive information on what has been changed (beyond the obvious), they are only informed that their mind was involuntarily altered. Note that psychosurgery or memory hacking can be used to make a victim forget the hacking alert warnings. Unless the hacking alert plug-in is also disabled or hacked, however, it will retain a log of the warnings.
GEAR|Persistance|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph,Pod,Eidolon|Low|(TH p. 140) This software makes it more difficult for the ego to be forcibly shut down when brainhacked. Apply an additional -10 modifier to the intruder's Infosec Test (in addition to the standard -30 modifier for brainhacking).
GEAR|Impersonate|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph,Pod,Eidolon|High|(TH p. 140) This upgrade provides the user with a library of mannerisms, vocal patterns, and other social cues. This aids Impersonation Tests, even when communicating verbally or via avatars, providing a +10 bonus. The processor in this upgrade can also help analyze a target's mannerisms and duplicate them more effectively. To duplicate someone's patterns, the character must first observe their interactions and make a Kinesics Task Action Test with a timeframe of 1 hour. Success allows them to accumulate a sufficient quantity of data to allow this upgrade to duplicate this person's phrasing and patterns of digital activity; increase the modifier for Impersonation Tests to +30 to impersonate the target. Note that this upgrade does not provide the character with the skills, memories, or other traits of the ego they are impersonating. This upgrade can also be set to randomize the emotive patterns exhibited by the user, so their phrasing and mannerisms do not identify them as anyone. This applies a +30 modifier to the Deception or Impersonation rolls in Opposed Tests when someone else is trying to use Kinesics to identify the character's true identity.
GEAR|Increased Speed|Augmentation||||||||||||Eidolon|Expensive|(TH p. 141) Infomorphs already have a higher innate speed than physical morphs, but some individuals need even more speed, and specially optimized code makes that possible. This upgrade increases the user's Speed by +1. Since even basic infomorphs possess a Speed of 3, this upgrade increases the infomorph's Speed to the maximum of 4. No other Speed modifiers may be used in conjunction with this upgrade. This upgrade does not provide extra Speed for cyberbrained characters.
GEAR|Panopticon|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph,Pod,Eidolon|High|(TH p. 141) The ubiquity of sensor system found in almost all habitats and spaceships means that any transhuman could theoretically monitor a dozen or more different locations to see what is occurring there. Unfortunately, most transhuman minds are simply not adapted to process that much data or to deal with so many different sources of information all at once. As a result, even infomorphs must normally switch their attention between the various locations and vantage points they are observing. Watching multiple views of a single location is no problem and usually provides the character with between +10 to +30 to their Perception Tests. Viewing different locations at one time, however, is far more difficult and taxing, requiring a Detailed Perception Quick Action (p. 190, EP) for each. Alternatively, the character can passively observe many locations/sensor feeds with automatic Basic Perception (p. 190, EP), but this imposes a -20 penalty to all of these Perception Tests due to distraction. The panopticon upgrade mitigates this limitation with sophisticated algorithms that help the ego analyze and process sensory input. The infomorph can use Detailed Perception on three locations/sensor feeds at once (increase this to 5 locations if the character also has multi-tasking) without any penalty. Alternatively, the infomorph only suffers a -10 distraction modifier when using Basic Perception to view multiple locations and feeds at once. This upgrade is common among habitat cyberbrains, as each multi-tasking module beyond the first allows Detailed Perception to be used on another 2 areas at once.
GEAR|Mental Stability|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph,Pod,Eidolon|Expensive|(TH p. 141) This upgrade bolsters the mind's capacity to handle mental shocks and makes it less vulnerable to emotional distress. The user's Lucidity increases by +5, which also increases Trauma Threshold by +1 and Insanity Rating by +10. This upgrade has no effect on the user's WIL or their rolls to resist stress. The user is no more likely than before to be able to resist mental stress. However, they can now handle more mental stress before suffering any form of instability.
GEAR|Mental Repair|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph,Pod,Eidolon|High|(TH p. 141) This upgrade continuously monitors and analyzes the user's mental patterns, then corrects and adjusts the user's mental processes to counter psychological stress. In effect, the character's mind benefits from continuous unconscious psychotherapy and heals mental stress far more rapidly and easily than normal. The character automatically makes a Willpower x 3 Test once a day. Every success eliminates one point of stress. If the character has already benefited from psychotherapy (p. 215, EP) that day or any other effect that healed stress, trauma, or disorders, the test is not made. This upgrade has no effect on trauma or disorders.
GEAR|Monitor Module|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Moderate|(TH p. 197) A variant ghostrider module (p. 307, EP), the monitor module houses an observer ego (usually a monitor AI, see below) that keeps tabs on the character's movements, activities, and mesh traffic. Some monitor modules are installed discreetly, without the bearer being aware of the spy in their head; others are more overt about their presence, purpose, and activity. Monitors can access the mesh without the character's knowledge. If the morph is equipped with a puppet sock, the monitor ego can seize control of the morph. This implant is designed to be difficult to detect and identify; impose a ?10 penalty on appropriate skill tests. Attempts to hack into the Monitor Module suffer a ?20 modifier and can be actively countered by the monitor ego.
GEAR|Efficient Digestion|Augmentation||||||||||-5:SOM,-5:COO||Biomorph,Pod,Uplift|High|(TH p. 197) The character uses food and water more efficiently, to approximately 20% of normal caloric expenditure. The character functions normally by eating and drinking only once every five days. They can survive forty days without food and twenty-five days without water, though the effects of starvation become noticeable after ten days without food or water. These modifications come at a price, though, as physical strength and coordination are reduced in order to improve caloric usage efficiency: the character takes a ?5 penalty to SOM and COO. This augmentation is not compatible with the personal power plant implant.
GEAR|Fat Storage|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Pod,Uplift|High|(TH p. 197) This augmentation is based on traits displayed by camels to store and use fatty tissue as efficiently as possible. The character's fat tissue stores water far more efficiently than normal, which allows the character to survive three times as long as normal without food or water. The effects of this implant stack with efficient digestion, but are not compatible with the personal power plant implant. The character's fat tissue can be moved around the character's body to a certain degree, which can help the character survive extreme temperatures. In high temperatures, the fat can be concentrated as back humps to minimize the insulation that fat provides, while in extremely cold environments, the fat can be spread around to maximize insulation. This extends the character's maximum temperature tolerance by +10%, which stacks with the effect of temperature tolerance augmentations.
GEAR|Possum Cache|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|High|(TH p. 197) This augmentation may only be applied to morphs with a cyberbrain, ghostrider module, or monitor module. It enables an ego therein to continue using its access jacks, cyberbrain/module, and mesh inserts while hibernating or dead. It includes a backup power unit that kicks in when the cyberbrain or module stops receiving sufficient power from the morph's body. The access jacks, cyberbrain/module, and mesh inserts may continue to operate for 48 hours after the morph hibernates or dies. If the morph has the multitasking augmentation, it continues to function, but all other augmentations are inactive and cannot be used. Egos active in a dead/hibernating morph via a possum cache retain the morph's aptitude modifiers but do not suffer from the morph's wound penalties. Operating in this mode is stressful due to sensory deprivation. Every 24 hours the ego runs on a possum cache, it must make a WIL x 3 Test. Failure inflicts 1d10 SV. If the morph was killed/destroyed by head trauma, or if it takes more than 5 DV of damage to its head after death, the cyberbrain is considered destroyed, or at least too damaged to function properly. Note that damage from popping a stack does not count toward this total, but damage from intentionally burning a stack out (e.g., with an agonizer) does. Death or voluntary entry into hibernation are the only circumstances under which this augmentation functions. In case of any other game effect that would render the morph unconscious, this augmentation has no benefit. If the morph contains multiple cyberbrains or modules, the augmentation must be bought separately for each.
GEAR|Optogenetics Module|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(TH p. 197) This implant is designed to be used in biomorphs like the freeman (TH p. 191) that are genetically modified to make their neurons sensitive to light. This module establishes a network within the brain to manipulate these neurons with selective pulses of light. Whomever controls the optogenetics module (usually a monitor module muse or remote overseer) can trigger neuronal activity as desired. Use of this implant requires directly referencing the source material.
GEAR|Brain Box|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph,Pod|Moderate|(TH p. 198) Just as some people in the outer system prefer biomorphs with cyberbrains because of the speed and ease of both forking and resleeving, others prefer the durability and utility of synthmorphs, but do not wish to give up having an organic brain. Some have aesthetic objections, while others worry about a cyberbrain's vulnerability to hacking. Though they are unlikely to discuss this fact in public, asyncs need biological brains to remain sane. Any pod and any synthmorph that does not use either modular design or swarm composition can house a brain box. Choosing this modification removes the following enhancements from the morph: cyberbrain, mnemonic augmentation, and puppet sock. The CP and credit cost of the morph remains unchanged. Users can add mnemonic augmentation and puppet sock augmentations back in, but must purchase them normally. A brain box consists of a living human brain and a sturdy, well-padded, miniature life-support system for this brain. Brain boxes require the addition of a small amount of concentrated nutrients once every month. To avoid the necessity of these nutrients, users can also install a smaller, cheaper, and more limited version of the long-term life support augmentation (p. 189, Rimward) that is designed specifically for use with a brain box. This augmentation has a cost of High and recycles the necessary nutrients as long as the morph has sufficient electricity and can gain access to small amounts of water and carbon twice a year. Brain boxes are normally hidden from standard visual detection, but a few eccentrics show them off with a transparent aluminum casing, allowing observers to see that their morph contains a biological brain. The brains with brain boxes must be specifically customized to the morph (a process requiring 3 days and a healing vat). The morph's aptitude modifiers do not change.
GEAR|Smart Swarm|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph|High|(TH p. 198) The modular drones in this swarm are capable of forming shapes. A standard swarm can form a 1-meter tall body or base with up to 4 half-meter limbs. These limbs can engage in very limited physical activity and tool use. They are considered to have an aptitude maximum of 5 for COO, REF, and SOM. For strength/size-related options (p. 96), their Durability is halved. Any skill use involving leverage, strength, or fine dexterity suffers a ?30 modifier or may not be possible (gamemaster discretion). Shaped swarms can manipulate gear that is small in size (see Gear Sizes, p. 297, EP) or smaller without penalty. They suffer a ?30 modifier for manipulating medium-sized gear and cannot use larger gear. Shapes can be targeted in combat, though they usually gain the Small Size advantage (p. 95). A shaped swarm takes normal physical damage rather than following the combat rules for nanoswarms. 
GEAR|Digestive Symbiotes|Augmentation||||||||||||Biomorph,Synthmorph,Pod,Uplift|Low|(TH p. 198) The morph can survive on virtually any organic matter, be it grass, sawdust, or the sludge from a habitat's recycling system. Digestive symbiotes also allow the consumption of rotten or spoiled food; in combination with basic biomods, they prevent normal foodborn illnesses. The symbiotes don't eliminate toxins, however, nor do they make the stuff taste any better. At the gamemaster's discretion, certain substances may requires a WIL x 3 Test to eat.
GEAR|Holographic Projector|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph|Low|(TH p. 198) The morph has embedded and concealable projectors capable of projecting high-definition, ultrarealistic three-dimensional images and movies. From a distance (20+ meters), such holograms can be difficult to distinguish as fake, but up close they are easier to see for what they are (+20 Perception Test modifier). Holograms do not appear in wavelengths other than visual light, and so are easily identified by anyone with enhanced vision.
GEAR|Internal Rocket|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph|Moderate|(TH p. 198) This miniature metallic hydrogen rocket is specifically designed for low thrust. It provides an acceleration of up to 0.25 g, allowing the morph to take off and land on all moons and other small bodies in the solar system. This engine can operate for a total of one and a half hours before it requires refueling. Both the sundiver (p. 164, Sunward) and courier (p. 185, Rimward) are considered to have this enhancement.
GEAR|Brain Box Life Support|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph,Pod|High|(TH p. 198) To avoid the necessity of these nutrients, users can also install a smaller, cheaper, and more limited version of the long-term life support augmentation (p. 189, Rimward) that is designed specifically for use with a brain box. This augmentation recycles the necessary nutrients as long as the morph has sufficient electricity and can gain access to small amounts of water and carbon twice a year.
GEAR|Sound System|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph|Trivial|(TH p. 199) The character can emit sound through several concealed speakers in the morph. The sound system can go up to 200 decibels and reach a much wider frequency than standard transhuman hearing can pick up.
#GEAR|Articulated Gear Mount|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph|Low|(TH p. 210) Similar to an articulated weapon mount, this mount allows a piece of modularized gear to be manipulated independent of the flexbot's limbs.
#GEAR|Advanced Internal Articulation|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph|High|(TH p. 210) The design and arrangement of the flexbot's rigid superstructure is bleeding edge. The timeframe for shape changing is reduced by half. It also suffers no SOM penalties for hyper-extending its limbs. This modification must be added when the morph is first acquired.
#GEAR|Body Mass Converter|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph|High|(TH p. 210) The flexbot is able to convert small bits of its own body mass into ammunition or fabricator feedstock if needed. The bot may convert 1 DUR into 10 rounds of kinetic or spray weapon ammunition or 1 kilogram of inorganic feedstock.
#GEAR|Modularized Gear|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph|0|(TH p. 211) Allows any small-sized or smaller item of equipment to be directly integrated into the flexbot's body. Modularized gear can't be dropped, pickpocketed, or disarmed. A flexbot with the shape adjusting enhancement may retract modular gear into its body, making it extremely difficult to detect. Tests to find retracted modular gear using penetrative scans such as t-rays are at a ?30. Such gear is impossible to detect via visual inspection alone. No more than three pieces of modular gear may be installed on a given appendage. Devices requiring fine manipulation or aim, such as laser links and covert operation tools, must be installed on a limb with a full range of manipulative motion to be useful.
#GEAR|Reconfigurable Proprioception|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph|Expensive|(TH p. 211) Flexbots with the reconfigurable proprioception enhancement can instantaneously reconfigure the location and degrees of freedom in their joints, allowing amazing feats of balance and movement. The flexbot receives a +20 modifier on all Escape Artist Tests, a +10 on Freerunning Tests, and a +10 on Fray Tests against melee attacks and thrown weapons. Flexbots with this mod can even use their multi-jointed limb structure to get around opponents' guards in melee, like a flail. The bot gains a +10 on melee attacks and can ignore some physical obstacles (e.g., taking a swing at an opponent who's ducked around a corner). This bonus applies only against opponents who are defending themselves.
#GEAR|Squish Bot|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph|Expensive|(TH p. 211) The flexbot is of soft, flexible construction, consisting of reconfigurable parts in a liquid matrix with a soft outer skin. The flexbot must have the shape adjusting augmentation to take this augmentation. All shapeadjusting tasks take half the usual time. The flexbot may squeeze itself through holes as small as 10 centimeters in diameter, though doing so may require as long as a minute for the bot to extend itself into a long, narrow shape. Squishbots do not benefit from inherent synthmorph armor or from robotic armor, but they may have bioweave armor.
#GEAR|Mass Transfer|Augmentation||||||||||||Synthmorph|Moderate|(TH p. 211) The flexbot may transfer up to half of its Durability to another bot that also has the mass transfer enhancement. The donated mass may not cause the recipient bot to exceed its normal maximum Durability. Transferring mass doesn't transfer armor or any augmentations to the recipient bot. Transferring mass may change the target size of the donor bot (see Flexbot Size, p. 204). Damaged mass may also simply be dumped, enabling the module to discard damage and also wounds, at the cost of lower Durability.

While the sturdy hulder morph is designed for nomadic herders, the ariel morph is designed by people who wish to survive by hunting. Individuals sleeved in the ariel morph can hunt and eat Titanian caribou, but they most often eat the smaller rabbit-like creatures that Profunda designers have also recently designed to live on Titan. Ariel morphs have exoticlooking heads similar to those of hulder morphs, but they also possess sleek and streamlined humanoid bodies with four limbs and a pair of bat-like wings. These morphs have also been used by a few daring transhumans to explore the upper cloud layers of both Saturn and Uranus.||||

Adopted early on by some sports performers, it quickly became a favorite among criminal cartels and thugs. At 2.5 meters tall, the morph may have difficulty moving comfortably in all but the most open and uncrowded of habitats. This morph's claws extend from its knuckles and are more like reinforced bone brass knuckles.||||

They possess a swim bladder to control buoyancy. They can safely descend to 500 atmospheres of pressure.||||
MORPH|Cloud Skate|Biomorph|30,30,30,30,30,30,30|35|7|0/0|5:COG,5:REF,5:SOM,5:ANY|0|Basic Biomods, Basic Mesh Inserts, Bioweave Armor (Light), Cortical Stack, Direction Sense, Enhanced Vision, High Gravity Adaptation, Hydrostatic Pressure Adaptation, Long Term Life Support, Oxygen Reserve, Radiation Sense, Radar System, Swim Bladder, T-Ray Emitter, Temperature Tolerance: Cryonic, Wings,|55|60000|(TH p. 189) Like the surya and hulder morphs, the cloud skate is another biomorph that pushes the edge of what is possible. It is designed to be able to live in the atmospheres of gas giants, including Jupiter. This morph is shaped roughly like a tailless stingray with a pair of slender arms. The version of the swim bladder used by this morph provides neutral buoyancy in dense atmospheres, preventing it from sinking below a safe depth. Several small outer system collectives are planning to use these morphs to colonize the atmospheres of Saturn and Neptune and are also working on creating versions of animals and plants that can also live in these exotic environments.||||

It was developed in secret by a small group of unaffiliated async genehackers. It is only available to individuals who discover a connection to this unnamed, underground async network and then download the template from one of several secret mesh sites. The faust is a modified menton morph. Even under the most thorough scans, it appears to be nothing more than a mildly personalized version of that morph. ||||

The freeman biomorph offers rulers (some would say tyrants or dictators) a chance to offer citizens a new life without worrying about dissidence. Based on the splicer morph, the freeman is genetically modified to be more obedient, which results in lower Willpower. More insidiously, freeman morphs are genetically modified with a protein that makes their neurons sensitive to light. When combined with an optogenetics module implant (p. 197), these neurons can be activated and deactivated remotely, enabling a monitoring muse or meshed overseer to control the ego's behavior. (The specific behavior affected is chosen with each optogenetics module implant.) The freeman comes with a specialized monitor AGI installed in a modified ghostrider module. The monitor, usually a modified fork of the tyrant's muse, watches and reports all suspicious actions taken by the primary ego. The purpose of this implant is often concealed. Citizens who sleeve into a freeman morph are told the implant is a security measure that helps prevent infection from TITAN technology or some similar lie. The module is designed to resist tampering and will report to headquarters the instant it detects a hacker's intrusion. The monitor muse can manipulate the ego's behavior or even take control of the morph via its puppet sock, but avoids doing that unless absolutely necessary. Dictators do not want to reveal that their citizens have spies implanted in their skulls, watching them. Surprisingly, some people voluntarily sleeve into freeman morphs, preferring to hand responsibility and decision-making over to other parties, such as the Sendero Luminoso Benevolent Dictatorship habitat in the Neptunian Trojans.||||

MORPH|Grey|Biomorph|30,30,30,30,30,20,30|30|6|0/0|5:COG,5:WIL,5:ANY|0|Basic Biomods, Basic Mesh Inserts, Circadian Regulation, Clean Metabolism, Cortical Stack, Eidetic Memory, Emotional Dampers, Enhanced Vision, Math Boost,|25|30000|(TH p. 192) Originally created as part of a fad based on 20th-century images of aliens, the grey morph soon became popular with eccentric scientists and engineers. This morph's slender and weak-looking body stands only 1.5 meters tall, short compared to modern transhumans. Its distinctive large head and eyes strike many transhumans as disturbing.||||
MORPH|Hazer|Biomorph|30,30,30,30,30,30,30|35|7|0/0|5:COO,5:WIL,5:ANY,5:ANY|0|Basic Biomods, Basic Mesh Inserts, Cortical Stack, Enhanced Vision, Radiation Sense, Respirocytes, Temperature Tolerance: Cold,|35|20000|(RW p. 186) Hazers are tall, fine-boned morphs, lightly muscled but heavily insulated against loss of body heat. Even with all of their augmentations, hazers can't survive exposure to the frigid atmosphere of Titan-but they can handle it slightly longer than other morphs. Hazers tend to be fair and slender, with chiseled features. Some have features so angular or elfin that their beauty is alien and unsettling to other human phenotypes. Striking Looks and Uncanny Valley are both common morph traits.||||
MORPH|Hibernoids|Biomorph|25,25,25,25,25,25,25|35|7|0/0|5:INT,5:ANY|0|Basic Biomods, Basic Mesh Inserts, Cortical Stack, Circadian Regulation, Hibernation,|25|20000|(EP p. 140) Hibernoids have heavily-altered sleep patterns, requiring only 1-2 hours a day. They also have the ability to trigger a form of voluntary hibernation.||||
MORPH|Hulder|Biomorph|30,30,30,30,30,30,30|40|8|0/0|5:SOM,10:WIL,5:ANY|0|Basic Biomods, Basic Mesh Inserts, Bioweave Armor (Light), Cortical Stack, Digging Claws, Direction Sense, Enhanced Vision, Long Term Life Support, Oxygen Reserve, Radiation Sense, Swim Bladder, T-Ray Emitter, Temperature Tolerance: Cryonic,|50|40000|(RW p. 186) Hulder are engineered for survival in the Titanian wilds. In silhouette, their bodies resemble a longlegged great auk, though viewed up close, the resemblance to a bird ends. Hulder have no feathers, but rather smooth, rubbery charcoal or black skin covering a thick layer of nano-augmented blubber. What resembles a thick bill from a distance is actually a seamless protrusion of the face, packed with sensory augmentations. Hulder stand 2 meters tall and weigh on average 135 kilograms. Their sensory organs, webbed feet, and fingers are all cybernetic. Hulder can only tolerate temperatures hospitable to baseline transhumans for short periods of time. In the open, they must balance their bodies' chemical reservoirs with other hulder and caribou once per month or with a chemical reserve pack. A typical band of 2-6 hulder and 10-20 caribou can go about a year before having to visit a hab or a station like Huvudsk?r to replenish chemical reserves.||||
MORPH|Hyperbright|Biomorph|40,30,40,30,30,30,30|35|7|0/0|15:COG,10:INT,5:WIL,5:ANY|0|Basic Biomods, Basic Mesh Inserts, Circadian Regulation, Cortical Stack, Eidetic Memory, Endocrine Control, Grip Pads, Hyper Linguist, Math Boost, Mental Speed, Prehensile Feet,|70|40000|(RW p. 186) This morph is an attempt by a research team on Bright to create a successor to the menton, making it the most intelligence-enhanced morph ever created. Work on the hyperbright morph has been plagued with difficulties, as the designers attempt to push technical limits, creating a morph that can work at peak efficiency without distraction for long periods of time. In an effort to create a morph that proves their design and earns some positive reputation for their project, the creators took short cuts that caused the morph to have several distinctive and potentially annoying quirks, including an inherent need for drugs to stabilize its exotic neurochemistry. The result is a morph that is instantly recognizable by the brightly colored bony crest along the skull that helps cool its brain. Despite its quirks, the hyperbright has gained a small following among a number of scientists and engineers, especially since it has been optimized for use in the low-g environments of the outer system. When created or used on Bright, this morph is usually also fitted with the parallel processor nanoware (p. 189).||||
MORPH|Lunar Flier|Biomorph|30,30,30,30,30,30,30|30|6|0/0|5:COG,5:COO,5:ANY,5:ANY|0|Basic Biomods, Basic Mesh Inserts, Clean Metabolism, Cortical Stack, Enhanced Vision, Wings,|35|20000|(SW p. 162) Lunar Flyers resembles typical exalt morphs, except that they are lightly built, have larger lungs, and have feathered wings with a wingspan of 3 meters.||||
MORPH|Martian Alpiner|Biomorph|25,25,25,25,25,25,25|40|8|0/0|5:SOM|0|Basic Biomods, Basic Mesh Inserts, Cortical Stack, Direction Sense, Grip Pads, Low Pressure Tolerance, Oxygen Reserve, Respirocytes, Temperature Tolerance: Cold,|30|20000|(SW p. 162) Alpiners were a relatively common biomorph design on early frontier Mars. Avid rock climbers and outdoor types also favor this morph.||||
MORPH|Menton|Biomorph|30,30,30,30,30,30,30|35|7|0/0|10:COG,5:INT,5:WIL,5:ANY|0|Basic Biomods, Basic Mesh Inserts, Cortical Stack, Eidetic Memory, Hyper Linguist, Math Boost,|40|20000|(EP p. 139) Mentons are genetically modified to increase cognitive abilities, particularly learning ability, creativity, attentiveness, and memory. ||||
MORPH|Neotenic|Biomorph|30,30,30,30,30,20,30|30|6|0/0|5:COO,5:INT,5:REF,5:ANY|0|Basic Biomods, Basic Mesh Inserts, Cortical Stack,|25|20000|(EP p. 141) Neotenics are transhumans modified to retain a childlike form. They are smaller, more agile, inquisitive, and less resource depleting.||||
MORPH|Nomad|Biomorph|30,30,30,30,30,30,30|40|8|0/0|5:COO,5:REF,10:SOM,5:ANY|0|Basic Biomods, Basic Mesh Inserts, Cortical Stack, Efficient Digestion, Enhanced Respiration, Fat Storage, Medichines, Respirocytes, Temperature Tolerance: Cold, Toxin Filters,|30|20000|(TH p. 194) While synthmorphs are the first choice for many gatecrashers, morph designers have made great headway in creating biomorphs suitable for hazardous exoplanets. The nomad biomorph is optimized for operating in desert environments and takes many of its traits from the camel, prompting some observers to mistake the nomad for a pod morph. With an elongated face designed like a camel to trap water vapor in the nostrils as the morph exhales, nomads are clearly off-putting to many bioconservatives. Some models also have camel feet for better travels in sandy dune environments. Nomads are actually quite hefty under normal circumstances, as they are designed to be able to carry large amounts of fat tissue. Their fat tissue can be moved around their body to adapt to high or low temperatures. When nomads are in the field, however, they can become quite skinny, as they survive for months on their fat tissue alone.||||

Some scavengers and explorers still scour the ruins of habitats that were destroyed during the Fall. Others look for wealth and secrets in the quarantined zones on Luna and Mars. Some simply seek out remaining TITAN machines to destroy, wherever they may be found. The theseus is a popular biomorph for this type of work. Its medichines and nanophages keep the morph protected from most attacks by exsurgent nanotech, and the lack of a cyberbrain makes it less vulnerable to mind hacking.

The ayah pod morph is designed to fulfill all nurse and caretaker functions. Rather than trust lowerclass transhumans, hyperelites prefer AGI servants sleeved into ayah morphs, especially in polities where AGIs have few, if any, legal rights. Ayahs are almost always female with pleasant but not stunningly beautiful features. Most of the enhanced features of an ayah are built under the hood, so to speak. Their enhanced olfactory capabilities help them monitor the health and emotional state of their wards, as well as alert them to potential environmental dangers. Their ability to withstand temperature extremes and survive without air for short periods helps them protect and rescue their charges in an emergency, such as a hull breach or a fire. Ayahs are often modified with bioweave armor and implanted weapons so they can act as a last line of defense against potential attackers.||||

Originally popular among hyperelites who preferred smarter and distinctive AI-operated pets, they were also sometimes deployed on a covert basis as bodyguards or spies disguised as smart animals. Naturally these morphs were also embraced by people with a furry kink or who simply wanted to test-drive a body that was more bestial. Critter pods come in almost every conceivable type of animal shape, from cats to skunks to chimerical lizard-hyena hybrids. The vast majority are quadruped and stick close to the animal type's body plan, though anthropomorphic models are also popular and there is a great deal of bodysculpted variety. A model currently popular in the inner system is the bastet, a composite of several wild cat species that resembles a tawny panther or lion, often with intricate patterns based on Egyptian hieroglyphs in their fur. Some users prefer smaller models of this morph with the Reduced Size trait (p. 93).||||

Its streamlined form resembles a stylized squid and this morph can move swiftly in both water and air. It can suck either water or air into a cavity in its mantle and then expel it out a siphon in a chosen direction for fast, jet-like propulsion. While popular with neo-octopi, its speed and overall utility has made it an increasingly favorite option with others seeking an aquatic-adapted morph.||||

The original model was simply the designer's attempt to keep him and his crewmates alive on a ship with failing life support and recycling systems. From there, it has evolved into the ultimate survivor's morph, though the definition of survivor has now been extended to can take all of the drugs and still function sexually. This seems to be a selling point with the scum. Despite the morph's stooped posture, rat-like features, and pungent personal aroma, the implausibly sized secondary sexual characteristics make it the life of certain kinds of parties.||||

The design has since spread to those who wish to enjoy the advantages of sleeving in a synthmorph without the risk of brainhacking or who simply dislike the idea of using a cyberbrain (including some asyncs). Most models feature a stylized but transparent braincase, to show off the biocore's main feature, but others appear to be ordinary synthmorphs from the outside; only a detailed physical examination can determine that it actually contains a living brain.||||
MORPH|Blackbird|Synthmorph|25,25,25,25,25,25,25|25|5|2/2|5:COO,5:REF,5:ANY|0|Access Jacks, Basic Mesh Inserts, Cortical Stack, Cyberbrain, Enhanced Hearing, Enhanced Vision, Invisibility, Mnemonic Augmentation, Puppet Sock, Reduced Signature, Hopper, Winged,|45|45000|(TH p. 189) When they're seen at all, these morphs resemble a matte gray neo-corvid with many odd, sharp angles. Blackbirds are consummate stealth morphs, designed to evade visual observation and radar during recon or infiltration. In part due to aesthetics, they're a favorite of neo-ravens.||||

It is used by both couriers and smugglers throughout the outer system. This morph appears to be a roughly humanoid head and torso set on a conical base, with a total height of 1.5 meters, that makes it look rather like a four-armed chess piece. This base contains both the morph's ionic propulsion system, which doubles as a plasma sail in space, and an internal rocket. This miniature metallic hydrogen rocket is specifically designed for low thrust. It provides an acceleration of up to 0.25 g, allowing the morph to take off and land on all moons and other small bodies in the solar system. This engine can operate for a total of one and a half hours before it requires refueling. The morph's four slender arms fold flat against its torso when it is in flight. Its extensive sensor suit is useful for both navigation and various covert purposes.||||

It is found only in the armed forces of the Hyoden city-state on Callisto (though blackmarket blueprints/copies are rumored to be available elsewhere). A massive, squat quadrupedal morph designed to be operated by up to six egos simultaneously, the fenrir is more akin to a super-heavy tank than a regular morph. It is possible that a single ego could fill all six ego slots at once through the use of alpha forks, but this has never been tested. The most common weapons mounted are linked HEAP and/or plasmaburst seeker launchers, exoatmospheric plasma beam bolters, and machine railguns loaded with AP rounds.||||

It also includes a built-in laser as well as anti-detection measures. Its default mode is turbofan-driven rotorcraft; its light weight allows it to fly and hover, even in thin atmospheres and heavy gravities. In streamlined ionic mode, it can travel at high speeds and maneuver in hurricane-force winds. In vacuum, it can drive itself with thrust-vector nozzles. It is occasionally used for aerial reconnaissance, but is most popular with spies, thieves, and discrete bodyguards.||||
MORPH|Galatea|Synthmorph|30,30,30,30,30,30,30|40|8|6/6|5:COO,5:INT,10:SAV,5:ANY|0|Access Jacks, Basic Mesh Inserts, Chameleon Skin, Cortical Stack, Cyberbrain, Enhanced Hearing, Mnemonic Augmentation, Walker,|65|70000|(TH p. 192) A group of Lunar morph designers created this high-end synthmorph in an attempt to increase the social acceptance of synthmorphs by showcasing how attractive and versatile they can be. This elegant morph looks expensive and is designed to allow the user to master any social situation. A few media icons and socialites have already found that this morph's mixture of utility and novelty value has helped enhance their fame and reputation.||||

MORPH|Griefer|Synthmorph|20,20,20,20,20,20,20|20|4|4/4|-5:ANY,-5:ANY|0|Access Jacks, Basic Mesh Inserts, Cyberbrain, Holographic Projector, Sound System, Mnemonic Augmentation, Puppet Sock, Walker,|5|1000|(TH p. 192) Based on the case synthmorph design, griefers are used by vandals, terrorists, and dedicated trolls to harass enemies and antagonize the masses. Griefers have embedded sound and holographic display systems so they can easily harass an individual or an entire crowd. They are also typically equipped with numerous hacking tools and software aids, though they do not come with these by default. Most importantly, they are built without cortical stacks, so if they are destroyed, the ego cannot be interrogated through psychosurgery. Griefers are illegal in many habitats, especially in the Planetary Consortium, but DRM-free blueprints are easy to find in many darknets, thus making them a persistent annoyance in some systems. A few habitats have passed laws mandating that killing a griefer is not considered murder, assault, or even destruction of property.||||

However, many people in the inner system are not comfortable with using hulking synthmorphs as bodyguards or security personnel. Instead, some choose this subtle and extremely deadly alternative. This morph's enhanced senses allow it to more easily detect any threats to the person the user is guarding, and the built-in weaponry and moderate armor make it highly resistant to damage. The synthetic mask disguises it quite effectively as an olympian or fury morph.||||
MORPH|Guard Deluxe|Synthmorph|30,30,30,30,30,30,30|50|10|12/12|5:COO,5:REF,10:SOM,5:ANY|0|Access Jacks, Basic Mesh Inserts, Chemical Sniffer, Cortical Stack, Cyberbrain, Cyberclaws, Enhanced Vision, Hand Laser, Lidar, Mnemonic Augmentation, Neurachem (Level 1), Puppet Sock, Synthetic Mask, T-Ray Emitter, Nanophage, Weapon Mount: Concealed, Walker,|75|80000|(TH p. 192) This morph is used by both top-of-the-line security personnel and wealthy and powerful people who worry about kidnapping and similar threats and wish to be able to personally respond to any problems.||||

With its four pencil-thin telescoping legs fully extended, it can stand up to two meters tall, and its arms can also each reach up to two meters from the morph. These limbs can all be fully retracted and the user can also alter the morph's shape and appearance, causing it to look like almost any small object such as a briefcase, cleaning robot, or household appliance. This morph can easily fit through small spaces and hide itself with great ease and is ideal for infiltration and sabotage missions.||||
MORPH|Nautiloid|Synthmorph|30,30,30,30,30,30,30|200|40|10/10|5:SOM,5:ANY,5:ANY|0|Basic Mesh Inserts, Cortical Stack, Cyberbrain, Echolocation, Hydrostatic Pressure Adaptation, Mnemonic Augmentation, Pneumatic Limbs, Puppet Sock, Radar System, Radiation Sense, Swim Bladder, Telescoping Limbs, T-Ray Emitter, Internal Rocket, Submarine,|155|150000|(TH p. 193) Nautiloids are a hybrid of short-range spacecraft and submersible capable of holding up to six passengers and their gear. The morph is shaped like a van-sized nautilus, with crew space in the head and shell. A cluster of tentacular limbs mounted under the observation ports in the head provide both fine and brute force manipulation. Originally created for comet and asteroid mining, the design also proved useful for oceanic exploration by gatecrashing teams and Europans. The morph's interior includes a desktop cornucopia machine and a maker. It can deploy a pair of retractable pontoons for stability when floating on a liquid surface. A nautiloid's life support system can support its occupants for up to three months before replenishing-indefinitely if it has a source of hydrogen and oxygen. Nautiloids include radiation shielding, a small airlock, and a healing vat. The nautiloid is also available as a bot with no cyberbrain for the same cost. The bot version has no aptitude bonuses.||||

BACKGROUND|Ape Uplift|(TH p. 78) Neo-gorillas and neo-orangutans have integrated well with transhumanity, but they still haven't shaken their reputation for aggressiveness. Your drive to be in control of your social group and environment - a remnant of your species' social competitiveness and group hierarchies - chafes at the prejudice and restrictions you find in most habitats. Due to your perceived anti-social tendencies, it can be difficult to find a place in society outside of military, police, or criminal organizations.|10:Fray,10:Unarmed,20:Intimidation,|0|Brave, Social Stigma=AGI, |ANY|0|0||||||||
BACKGROUND|Bonobo Uplift|(TH p. 78) Your species is among the most enthusiastic when it comes to assimilating into transhuman cultures, and you are no exception. The large, vibrant social groups, the constant interaction, and the pervasive - if unspoken - focus on sex and sexuality makes your own impulses and tendencies an almost perfect fit. Although other uplifts might belittle you for pandering to transhumans, and some transhumans claim you're too naive to realize the way your uplifters moved your species towards work in entertainment, XP, and porn, you actually have many more opportunities and wider acceptance than almost any other uplifts except your cousins the chimps.

As a chimp, you don't suffer from the same level of scorn as other species and have more possibilities for success, but your life is still limited by laws and prejudice throughout the system.

While crows and ravens have been anthropomorphized for millenia, it is rarely with beneficial stereotypes. Your species is usually associated with death, trickery, stealing, vanity, or any other number of less-than-pleasant qualities.

You were specifically designed to blend in with transhumans and work closely with them. You'll never be truly human, or even truly biological like uplifts, but you at least can imagine what it's like to be a flesh-and-blood human.

Either way, you left the Earth with nothing, and you spent years selling your time and labor as an indenture. Now you've earned your freedom and are taking your first cautious steps back into transhuman society as your own person.

Whether raised as part of a religious cult, social experiment or anti-tech cell, you spent most of your life isolated. Now you are starting to venture into the wider system and find that much of what you came to expect is wrong. The TITANs have not left everything in a shambles and there are honest people in other habitats that you can count on.

During the catastrophe, your homeworld was flooded with refugees and a few exsurgent outbreaks have left physical and psychological scars behind. Lunars think of themselves as a pragmatic people, even if others think they are paranoid, and you are likely to have been shaped by the consevative ideals back home even if you don't share them.

Some AGIs, especially those designed to work closely with humans, may try to pretend at being human but there is never any doubt in your mind about what you are. Every thought and impulse is logical and systematic, every risk objective and calculated, and every resource expendable under some scenario.

You are familiar with the cramped confines of spaceflight and life aboard older stations and habitats, the reality of life for most of transhumanity. Whether a science posting, commercial endeavor or exploratory outpost, your home has undoubtedly been transformed as a result of the Fall as space is at more of a premium than ever before. You might be fulfilling a role similar to your original assignment or you might be taking advantage of the new world (and possibly new political system) to find a new life for yourself.|10:TECHNICAL#Academics#Profession,10:Freefall#Pilot=Spacecraft,20:NETWORKING,|0|NONE|ANY|0|0||||||||
BACKGROUND|Parrot Uplift|(TH p. 80) You have an easier time than most other uplift species when dealing with transhumans, as parrots were often viewed as smart and beautiful companion animals. As most people have positive stereotypes that you'll be gregarious and entertaining, it's easier to get on in life, but that also requires playing in to those stereotypes with funny impressions, non-sequitors, and keeping your plumage bright.|10:Flight,20:Impersonation,10:NETWORKING,|0|First Impression, Social Stigma=Uplift, |ANY|0|0||||||||
BACKGROUND|Pig Uplift|(TH p. 80) You have more of a place in society than many uplifts. Although your species was only recently uplifted, it has quickly become widespread because you make excellent workers. Pigs are smart, dedicated, have excellent memories, and can pick up trades quickly. You left the lab with some in-demand skills, an honest shot at a job, and a way to take care of yourself. There's still descrimination, and you have to watch for some legal restriction here and there, but by sticking to the right habs and keeping your snout down there's a good life if you work for it.|10:Investigation,10:Perception,20:Scrounging,10:NETWORKING,10:Profession,|0|Impared Balance (Level 1), Oblivious, Social Stigma=AGI, |ANY|0|0||||||||

After years in storage, simulspace, or as an infomorph, you were one of the few to be re-instantiated with a new morph. Now you have the rest of your life in front of you, even as your past continues to claw its way into your nightmares. What sort of world is out there after so many have died? What does it mean that you are among the casualties? How do you know your old self is really gone and not still out there suffering?

BACKGROUND|Scumborn|(EP p. 132) You were raised in the nomadic and chaotic lifestyle common to Scum barges, meaning you've been creating your own petals since you could walk. Since your earliest memories, boundaries and rules were non-existent. If you wanted to touch a hot cooking surface, try a drink of alcohol, or fight and kill a stray cat then more power to you! Now that the Scum have signed on with the Autonomist Alliance there are more and more people taking on the lifestyle as a legitimate way of life. If they didn't grow up on the barges, though, they usually have one remnant hang-up or another.

Your clan shared the northern deserts of Mars with the maker clans - your allies and sometimes blood relations. Your upbringing taught you both to survive and to evade the notice of greedy hypercorps.

Though you have been well-accultured to transhuman society and are not as strongly influenced by your genetic past than others of your species, your life is limited by the prejudices and laws you face in habitats throughout the system. As you seek to discover yourself and your place in broader transhumanity, you are bombarded by the political clamor of your uplifted brethren, basic questions of personhood in many political systems, and grappling with how much of you is you... and how much is conditioning.|10:Fray,10:Perception,20:KNOWLEDGE,20:KNOWLEDGE,|0|Social Stigma=Uplift, |Neo-Avian,Neo-Hominid,Octomorph,Neanderthal,Chickcharnie,Hypergibbon,Neo-Beluga,Neo-Dolphin,Neo-Gorilla,Neo-Orca,Neo-Pig,Neo-Porpoise,Neo-Whale,Takko,Cerean Beluga,Cerean Dolphin,Cerean Orca,Cerean Porpoise,Cerean Whale,Cerean Octomorph,Cerean Takko,Europan Beluga,Europan Dolphin,Europan Orca,Europan Porpoise,Europan Whale,Europan Octomorph,Europan Takko,Critter,Flying Squid,Opteryx|0|0||||||||

FACTION|Anarchist|(EP p. 132) You are opposed to hierarchy, favoring flat forms of social organization and directly democratic decision making. You believe power is always corrupting and everyone should have a say in the decisions that affect their lives.

Though the swarm can meld together into a roughly child-sized shape, the swarm is incapable of tackling physical tasks like grabbing, lifting, or holding as a unit. Individual bugs, however, are quite capable of interfacing with electronics. Swarms cannot carry most gear or wear armor, and may not make strength-based SOM-linked skill tests.

FTRAIT|Large Size|0|Bruiser|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|The morph is significantly larger than a normal transhuman, which has its advantages and disadvantages. The character counts as a large target in combat, granting all enemies a +10 bonus on attack rolls against the character. Their mass works against them; double the damage from falling or collisions after armor is applied. The character gains the reach advantage (p. 204, EP) against standard-size targets (double this against small targets) and can also wield two-handed weapons in one hand without penalty. At the gamemaster's discretion, the character may suffer a ?20 modifier when handling small items, assuming they come equipped with no fine manipulators.

FTRAIT|Hoarder|0|Corvid Uplift|None|None|FALSE|FALSE|With the limitations on living space and need for resource management in all but the wealthiest habs, most transhumans are used to living with a minimal number of personal possessions. The flexibility and multi-purpose nature of most objects and availability of information, entertainment, and communication over digital or VR services all allow this to work well, but hoarders have a psychological compul- sion to keep things that they don't need and serve no purpose. Particularly common among corvid uplifts and some Fall survivors that lost everything, characters with this trait have a hard time giving away or disposing of things. Unless their behavior is somehow managed, they will accumulate over- whelming collections of junk. Each day, the character must make a WIL x 3 Test to keep their compulsion under control. If they fail, they will keep any objects they would normally throw away or recycle (food packaging, drink bulbs, broken or useless objects like dead ectos, ammunition clips, and the like) and must acquire one new item that day; all of those items will be added to their hoard. Hoarders can force themselves to ignore this compulsion for a day by taking one point of stress damage. If they ever attempt to clean out their hoard voluntarily, or if the hoard is significantly reduced (by catastrophe or by hab maintenance workers forcibly removing it), the character takes (1d10 / 2) + 2 SV.||||||||

Some morphs can hold small-sized or smaller tools, weapons, and other objects between their paws or in their mouths, for example, but unless these items have been specifically designed to operate with this morphology, the character will suffer a ?30 modifier to use or may not be able to use them at all (gamemaster discretion). Objects that don't require physical manipulation, such as tools controlled by wireless commands, may be used normally.

FTRAIT|Real World Naivete|0|Emergent AGI|None|None|FALSE|FALSE|Due to their background, the character has very limited personal experience with the real (physical) worldor they have spent so much time in simulspace that their functioning in real life is impaired. They lack an understanding of many physical properties, social cues, and other factors that people with standard human upbringings take for granted. This lack of common sense may lead the character to misunderstand how a device works or to misinterpret someones body language. Once per game session, the gamemaster may intentionally mislead the character when giving them a description about some thing or some social interaction. This falsehood represents the characters misunderstanding of the situation, and should be roleplayed appropriately, even if the player realizes the characters mistake.

This lack of common sense may lead the character to misunderstand how a device works or to misinterpret someones body language. Once per game session, the gamemaster may intentionally mislead the character when giving them a description about some thing or some social interaction. This falsehood represents the characters misunderstanding of the situation, and should be roleplayed appropriately, even if the player realizes the characters mistake.

Once per game session (preferably at a time that will maximize drama or hilarity), the gamemaster can call for the character to make a MOX x 10 Test (using their current Moxie score). If the character fails, the morph immediately suffers 1 wound resulting from some mechanical failure, electrical glitch, or other breakdown. This wound may be repaired as normal.||||||||

Though most non-mammalian morphs are developed without allergies, some are occasionally overlooked. Common augmentations may not be available for this morph or may need extra time to prepare. Medicine: Uplift or Medicine: Exotic Biomorph is used to medically treat these morphs. Apply a ?20 modifier to any other Medicine skills used to heal or augment the morph; gamemasters should also feel free to increase this modifier to ?30 and/or adjust the timeframe based on the resources available to the medical staff.

FTRAIT|Temperature Intolerance (Warm)|0|Hulder|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|The morph is adapted for extreme cold and has difficulty dissipating body heat in temperatures tolerated by normal transhumans. When exposed to vacuum or temperatures above 5 C for more than 10 minutes, the character suffers a -10 modifier to all actions. At 10 C, increase the modifier to -20. At temperatures above 25 C, the character may suffer 1d10 DV per hour exposed from overheating, at the gamemaster's discretion. These effects can be nullified by wearing a vacsuit, the application of some sort of cooling system, or returning to a suitably cold environment.||||||||

FTRAIT|Addiction: Confurt (Level 1)|0|Hyperbright|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|The morph is addicted to Confurt to a degree that impacts the character's physical health. Players and gamemasters should work together to agree on addictions that are appropriate for their game. A minor addiction is largely kept under control it does not ruin the character's life, though it may create some difficulties. The character may not even recognize or admit they have a problem.

FTRAIT|Fast Metabolism|0|Hyperbright|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|The morph's metabolism runs hot, requiring the character to eat two to three times as much food as a normal character with similar body mass. Food tends to be plentiful and cheap in most transhuman settlements, but this trait can pose a problem in remote areas or when visiting settlements with limited resources. The character must plan ahead and pack enough food on expeditions. If the character is eating off their rep, they must expend two trivial favors each day for the additional food they require. If the character is unable to obtain enough food, they lose SOM at the rate of one point per day until they resume their usual caloric intake.||||||||

Food tends to be plentiful and cheap in most transhuman settlements, but this trait can pose a problem in remote areas or when visiting settlements with limited resources. The character must plan ahead and pack enough food on expeditions. If the character is eating off their rep, they must expend two trivial favors each day for the additional food they require. If the character is unable to obtain enough food, they lose SOM at the rate of one point per day until they resume their usual caloric intake.||||||||

FTRAIT|Planned Obsolescence|0|Martian Alpiner|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|The morph is a hypercorp model that requires periodic GSP (Genetic Service Pack) therapy. For every three months of game time, the character must spend credits equal to 10% the cost of the morph on GSP upgrades. If they fail to do so, the morph's SOM is reduced by 5 until the character gets their GSP therapy. These penalties are cumulative over time (at 6 months, 9 months, etc.), but getting GSP therapy once removes all penalties. The character suffers no SOM loss if the majority of a given 3 month period was spent in hibernation, in a healing vat, or in some other form of metabolic suspension. The SOM reduction is due to low level neural degradation, minor tumors, joint pain, and other problems that crop up and express later as hypercorp genetic designers working on tight budgets and tighter deadlines race to release morph models with extra value-added features. While theoretically over many years this trait would lead to the early death of the morph, in game terms the morph stops accruing penalties when its SOM is reduced to 5. The character regains their normal SOM score if they resleeve.||||||||

FTRAIT|Impared Balance (Level 1)|0|Pig Uplift|None|None|FALSE|FALSE|This neo-pig's brain has not been fully adapted to the  bipedal stance and still suffers occasional difficulties with balance. The character suffers a ?10 modifier to any Climbing, Freerunning, or similar test involving balance or upright movement.||||||||
FTRAIT|Oblivious|0|Pig Uplift|None|None|FALSE|FALSE|The character is particularly oblivious to events around them or anything other than what their attention is focused on. They suffer a -10 modifier to Surprise Tests and their modifier for being Distracted is -30 rather than the usual -20 (see Basic Perception).||||||||
FTRAIT|Social Stigma (Uplift)|0|Pig Uplift|None|None|FALSE|FALSE|An unfortunate aspect of the character's background means that they suffer from a stigma in certain social situations. They are an Uplift. In social situations where the character's nature is known to someone who view that nature with distaste, fear, or repugnance, they suffer a -10 to -30 modifier (gamemaster's discretion) to social skill tests.||||||||
FTRAIT|Social Stigma (Pleasure Pod)|0|Pleasure Pod|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|An unfortunate aspect of the characters background means that they suffer from a stigma in certain social situations. Due to the use of a Pleasure Pod morph, you may be viewed distastefully in many circles. In social situations where the characters nature is known to someone who view that nature with distaste, fear, or repugnance, they suffer a 10 to 30 modifier (gamemasters discretion) to social skill tests.||||||||

FTRAIT|High-Temperature Operation|0|Q-Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|This morph has been designed to operate only in high-temperature environments, enabling them to withstand temperatures up to 1,000 C. This morph loses 1 point of COO for every 5 minutes it spends at temperatures lower than 250 C, and 1 point of COO for every minute that it spends below 150 C. When its COO equals zero the morph becomes completely immobile. This same penalty is applied to all COO-based skill rolls. The morph's cyberbrain and mesh access still work in these circumstances, but the morph cannot physically move under its own power. Even if placed back in higher temperatures, if it was previously reduced to total immobility, the morph halves its COO and SOM (round down) until it has been serviced. It provides 5 points of Energy armor against heat-based attacks.||||||||
FTRAIT|Large Size|0|Q-Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|The morph is significantly larger than a normal transhuman, which has its advantages and disadvantages. The character counts as a large target in combat, granting all enemies a +10 bonus on attack rolls against the character. Their mass works against them; double the damage from falling or collisions after armor is applied. The character gains the reach advantage (p. 204, EP) against standard-size targets (double this against small targets) and can also wield two-handed weapons in one hand without penalty. At the gamemaster's discretion, the character may suffer a ?20 modifier when handling small items, assuming they come equipped with no fine manipulators. Naturally, they may also have difficulty with armor, clothing, and other gear manufactured for smaller morphs, as well as the cramped confines of many habitats.||||||||

FTRAIT|Reaper|0|Reaper|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|The Reaper has 4 arms and 4 articulated weapon mounts.||||||||
FTRAIT|Planned Obsolescence, |0|Regular Ruster|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|The morph is a hypercorp model that requires periodic GSP (Genetic Service Pack) therapy. For every three months of game time, the character must spend credits equal to 10% the cost of the morph on GSP upgrades. If they fail to do so, the morph's SOM is reduced by 5 until the character gets their GSP therapy. These penalties are cumulative over time (at 6 months, 9 months, etc.), but getting GSP therapy once removes all penalties. The character suffers no SOM loss if the majority of a given 3 month period was spent in hibernation, in a healing vat, or in some other form of metabolic suspension. The SOM reduction is due to low level neural degradation, minor tumors, joint pain, and other problems that crop up and express later as hypercorp genetic designers working on tight budgets and tighter deadlines race to release morph models with extra value-added features. While theoretically over many years this trait would lead to the early death of the morph, in game terms the morph stops accruing penalties when its SOM is reduced to 5. The character regains their normal SOM score if they resleeve.||||||||
FTRAIT|Edited Memories|0|Re-Instantiated|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|At some point in the character's past, the character had certain memories strategically removed or otherwise lost to them. This may have been done to intentionally forget an unpleasant or shameful experience or to make a break with the past. The memory may also have been lost by an unexpected death (with no recent backup), or it may have been erased against the character's will. Whatever the case, the memory should bear some importance, and there should exist either evidence of what happened or NPCs who know the full story. This is a tool the gamemaster can use to haunt the character at some future point with ghosts from their past.||||||||
FTRAIT|Uncanny Valley|0|Remade|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|There is a point where synthetic human looks become uncannily realistic and human-seeming, but they remain just different enough that their looks seem creepy or even repulsive a phenomenon called the uncanny valley. Morphs whose looks fall into this range suffer a -10 modifier on social skill tests when dealing with humans. This modifier does not apply to interactions with xenomorphs or those with the infolife or uplift backgrounds.||||||||
FTRAIT|Real World Naivete|0|Research Infolife|None|None|FALSE|FALSE|Due to their background, the character has very limited personal experience with the real (physical) worldor they have spent so much time in simulspace that their functioning in real life is impaired. They lack an understanding of many physical properties, social cues, and other factors that people with standard human upbringings take for granted. This lack of common sense may lead the character to misunderstand how a device works or to misinterpret someones body language. Once per game session, the gamemaster may intentionally mislead the character when giving them a description about some thing or some social interaction. This falsehood represents the characters misunderstanding of the situation, and should be roleplayed appropriately, even if the player realizes the characters mistake. This trait should only be available to characters with the infolife or re-instantiated backgrounds, though the gamemaster may allow it for characters who have extensive virtual reality/XP use in their personal histories.||||||||
FTRAIT|Social Stigma (AGI)|0|Research Infolife|None|None|FALSE|FALSE|An unfortunate aspect of the characters background means that they suffer from a stigma in certain social situations. They are an AGI in a post-Fall society plagued by fear of artificial intelligence.

FTRAIT|Non-Mammalian Biochemistry|0|Ripwing|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|Biomorphs (including pods) with this trait are developed from non-mammalian biologies. The state of medicine for these morphs is often not quite as advanced as it is for humans, and certain common drugs and medical treatments may not work on the morph or may have drastically different results. Though most non-mammalian morphs are developed without allergies, some are occasionally overlooked. Common augmentations may not be available for this morph or may need extra time to prepare. Medicine: Uplift or Medicine: Exotic Biomorph is used to medically treat these morphs. Apply a ?20 modifier to any other Medicine skills used to heal or augment the morph; gamemasters should also feel free to increase this modifier to ?30 and/or adjust the timeframe based on the resources available to the medical staff. Morphs with this trait count as exotic and inflict ?30 modifiers to Alienation and Integration Tests (p. 272, EP). This trait is only available to morphs created from non-mammalian biochemistries. The following existing morphs are considered to have the Non-Mammalian Biochemistry trait: chickcharnie, hulder, neoavian, novacrab, octomorph, ripwing, salamander.||||||||

FTRAIT|Coronal Adaptation|0|Salamander|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|For biomorphs, this radical alteration enables the subject's metabolism to live off solar energy, using medichines to repair radiation damage. This same metabolism also generates powerful electromagnetic fields that protect the character from the intense temperatures and radiation in the coronal environment and even enable the character to sail the solar winds. Morphs with this adaptation cannot survive outside the coronal environment (or similar environments) for more than a few days without extensive medical support. Coronal adaptation can only be applied to morphs that also have medichines (p. 308, EP).  Generated electromagnetic fields also protect the morph and enable propulsion along solar magnetic lines. This adaptation provides a +10 modifier to the biomorph's Free Fall skill tests in the presence of strong electromagnetic fields. It also provides 10 points of Energy armor against heat and electromagnetic-based attacks.||||||||

FTRAIT|Unattractive (Level 2)|0|Samsa|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|In a time when good looks are easily purchased, this morph is conspicuously ugly. As unattractiveness is increasingly associated with being poor, backward, or genetically defective, responses to a lack of good looks range from distaste to horror.

FTRAIT|Alien Biochemistry|0|Scurrier|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|It is an impressive feat that creatures that evolved on separate worlds with different biochemistries are now being transformed into pods by transhuman geneticists. In fact, the biochemistries of these creatures are far less understood than that of transhumans. What this means is that drugs, chemicals, bioware augmentations, and cybernetic implants may have unpredictable effects on the pod. Drug treatments beneficial to transhumans may not function at all, for example, while something that transhumans regularly eat or handle may in fact be toxic to the pod and trigger an anaphylactic response. The gamemaster decides when this factor will play a role, based on the pod biochemistry's similarity to that of transhumans and numerous other factors. Certain augmentations may simply not be available, having not yet been invented for the alien physiology in question. While efforts have been made to provide these pods with their equivalent of basic biomods, the full protections offered by those enhancements may simply not be available. This means that the pod may or may not be vulnerable to such things as disease, aging, lack of sleep, long-term exposure to microgravity, shock from injuries, allergies, or other biological problems that transhumanity has attempted to eradicate. Likewise, the pod might not be able to heal quickly or regenerate limbs. It is also possible that the pod may be burdened with unusual biological problems inherent to its species, such as bizarre gastrointestinal issues, hacking up hairballs, respiratory distress, or an alien version of leukemia. Gamemasters are encouraged to be inventive. Morphs with alien biochemistry count as exotic and inflict -30 modifiers to Alienation and Integrity Tests (p. 272, EP).

FTRAIT|Uncanny Valley|0|Synth|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|There is a point where synthetic human looks become uncannily realistic and human-seeming, but they remain just different enough that their looks seem creepy or even repulsive a phenomenon called the uncanny valley. Morphs whose looks fall into this range suffer a -10 modifier on social skill tests when dealing with humans. This modifier does not apply to interactions with xenomorphs or those with the infolife or uplift backgrounds.||||||||

FTRAIT|Social Stigma (Uplift)|0|Uplift|None|None|FALSE|FALSE|An unfortunate aspect of the character's background means that they suffer from a stigma in certain social situations. They are an Uplift. In social situations where the character's nature is known to someone who view that nature with distaste, fear, or repugnance, they suffer a -10 to -30 modifier (gamemaster's discretion) to social skill tests.||||||||
FTRAIT|Social Stigma (Pod)|0|Vacuum Pod|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|An unfortunate aspect of the characters background means that they suffer from a stigma in certain social situations. Due to the use of a Pod morph, you may be viewed distastefully in many circles.

FTRAIT|Limber (Level 1)|0|Venusian Glider|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|The morph is especially flexible and supple, capable of graceful contortions and interesting positions. At Level 1, the character can smoke with their toes, do the splits, and squeeze into small, cramped spaces. This trait is only available to biomorphs.||||||||
FTRAIT|Alien Biochemistry|0|Whiplash|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|It is an impressive feat that creatures that evolved on separate worlds with different biochemistries are now being transformed into pods by transhuman geneticists. In fact, the biochemistries of these creatures are far less understood than that of transhumans. What this means is that drugs, chemicals, bioware augmentations, and cybernetic implants may have unpredictable effects on the pod. Drug treatments beneficial to transhumans may not function at all, for example, while something that transhumans regularly eat or handle may in fact be toxic to the pod and trigger an anaphylactic response. The gamemaster decides when this factor will play a role, based on the pod biochemistry's similarity to that of transhumans and numerous other factors. Certain augmentations may simply not be available, having not yet been invented for the alien physiology in question. While efforts have been made to provide these pods with their equivalent of basic biomods, the full protections offered by those enhancements may simply not be available. This means that the pod may or may not be vulnerable to such things as disease, aging, lack of sleep, long-term exposure to microgravity, shock from injuries, allergies, or other biological problems that transhumanity has attempted to eradicate. Likewise, the pod might not be able to heal quickly or regenerate limbs. It is also possible that the pod may be burdened with unusual biological problems inherent to its species, such as bizarre gastrointestinal issues, hacking up hairballs, respiratory distress, or an alien version of leukemia. Gamemasters are encouraged to be inventive. Morphs with alien biochemistry count as exotic and inflict -30 modifiers to Alienation and Integrity Tests (p. 272, EP). This trait is only available to pods created from alien life.||||||||

FTRAIT|Small Size|0|Wizard|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|The morph is significantly smaller than a normal transhuman, roughly child-sized. The character counts as a small target in combat; apply a ?10 modifier to attacks against the character. Standard-size opponents have a reach advantage against the character and large and very large opponents will have double this advantage. The character may also, at the gamemaster's discretion, suffer a ?20 modifier when handling medium-sized gear or two-handed weapons that have not been modified for their size.

MNTRAIT|Addiction (Major)|-20|Ego,Morph|NONE|NONE|TRUE|TRUE|(-20 cp) Addiction comes in two forms: mental (affecting the ego) and physical (affecting the biomorph). The character or morph is addicted to a drug (p. 317), stimulus (XP), or activity (mesh use) to a degree that impacts the character's physical or mental health. Players and gamemasters should work together to agree on addictions that are appropriate for their game. Addiction comes in three levels of severity: minor, moderate, or major: Major: A character with a major addiction is on the rapid road to ruin. They face cravings every 6 hours, and suffer a -10 DUR penalty as their health is affected. If they fail to get their regular dosage, they suffer a -30 modifier on all actions until they do. If their life hasn't already been ruined by their obsession, it soon will be.||||||||
MNTRAIT|Addiction (Minor)|-5|Ego,Morph|NONE|NONE|TRUE|TRUE|(-5 cp) Addiction comes in two forms: mental (affecting the ego) and physical (affecting the biomorph). The character or morph is addicted to a drug (p. 317), stimulus (XP), or activity (mesh use) to a degree that impacts the character's physical or mental health. Players and gamemasters should work together to agree on addictions that are appropriate for their game. Addiction comes in three levels of severity: minor, moderate, or major: Minor: A minor addiction is largely kept under control-it does not ruin the character's life, though it may create some difficulties. The character may not even recognize or admit they have a problem. The character must indulge the addiction at least once a week, though they can go for longer without too much difficulty. If they fail to get their weekly dose, they suffer a -10 modifier on all actions until they get their fix.||||||||
MNTRAIT|Addiction (Moderate)|-10|Ego,Morph|NONE|NONE|TRUE|TRUE|(-10 cp) Addiction comes in two forms: mental (affecting the ego) and physical (affecting the biomorph). The character or morph is addicted to a drug (p. 317), stimulus (XP), or activity (mesh use) to a degree that impacts the character's physical or mental health. Players and gamemasters should work together to agree on addictions that are appropriate for their game. Addiction comes in three levels of severity: minor, moderate, or major: Moderate: A moderate addiction is in full swing. The character obviously has a problem, and must satisfy the addiction at least once a day. If they fail to do so, they may suffer mood swings, compulsive behavior, physical sickness, or other side effects until they indulge their craving. Apply a -20 modifier to all of the character's actions until they get their fix. Additionally, a character with this level of addiction suffers a -5 DUR penalty.||||||||
MNTRAIT|Aggressive GRM|-10|Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-10 cp) This trait is generally only found on uplift biomorphs, but might be included on any unusual high-end or custom biomorphs. A much more aggressive version of the genetic rights management used in rusters and other morphs that require maintenance through GSPs (see Planned Obsolescence, p. 165, Sunward), the genehacking used in creating this morph is atypical and includes many sections of suppressed effects and potential problems that make it difficult for anyone not familiar with the initial design to modify the morph. Unless unlocked by the designer through further genehacking, this morph is sterile, and will reject any biomods not listed as standard for the morph. Worse, due to the extensive and limiting manipulation of the morph's DNA, it is much more prone to cancers and longevity issues than other morphs and has an average life expectancy of only 30-40 years. At the gamemaster's discretion, Medicine Tests to modify or even heal this morph may suffer modifiers ranging from ?10 to ?30.||||||||
MNTRAIT|Drug Fiend|-10|Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-10 cp) The character or morph has a weak resistance to addiction. Addiction Tests (including attempts to resist addiction cravings) are made with a -20 modifier.||||||||
MNTRAIT|Fast Metabolism|-5|Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-5 cp) The morph's metabolism runs hot, requiring the character to eat two to three times as much food as a normal character with similar body mass. Food tends to be plentiful and cheap in most transhuman settlements, but this trait can pose a problem in remote areas or when visiting settlements with limited resources. The character must plan ahead and pack enough food on expeditions. If the character is eating off their rep, they must expend two trivial favors each day for the additional food they require. If the character is unable to obtain enough food, they lose SOM at the rate of one point per day until they resume their usual caloric intake. This trait is only available for biomorphs (including uplifts and pods).||||||||
MNTRAIT|Genetic Defect (Major)|-20|Morph|NONE|NONE|TRUE|TRUE|(-20 cp) The morph is not gene_x001E_fixed, and in fact suffers from a genetic disorder or other impairing mutation. The player and gamemaster should agree on a defect appropriate to their game. Some possibilities include: heart disease, diabetes, cystic fibrosis, sickle-cell disease, hypertension, hemophilia, or color blindness. A genetic disorder that creates minor complications and/or occasional health problems would be worth 10 CP, a defect that significantly impairs the character's regular functioning or that inflicts chronic health problems is worth 20 CP. The gamemaster must determine the exact effects of the disorder on gameplay, as appropriate. This trait is only available for flats.||||||||
MNTRAIT|Genetic Defect (Minor)|-10|Morph|NONE|NONE|TRUE|TRUE|(-10 cp) The morph is not gene_x001E_fixed, and in fact suffers from a genetic disorder or other impairing mutation. The player and gamemaster should agree on a defect appropriate to their game. Some possibilities include: heart disease, diabetes, cystic fibrosis, sickle-cell disease, hypertension, hemophilia, or color blindness. A genetic disorder that creates minor complications and/or occasional health problems would be worth 10 CP, a defect that significantly impairs the character's regular functioning or that inflicts chronic health problems is worth 20 CP. The gamemaster must determine the exact effects of the disorder on gameplay, as appropriate. This trait is only available for flats.||||||||
MNTRAIT|Impared Proprioception|-10|Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-10 cp) This trait is only available to octomorphs and flying squid morphs. Baseline cephalopods lack a sense of proprioception in their arms and tentacles, meaning they only know where their limbs are by looking at them. Though a standard proprioceptive sense was added to most octomorph and flying squid models, a number of germlines lack the proper neural structure. A morph with this trait suffers a ?10 modifier on Fray Tests to avoid attacks or get out of the way and gains no benefits from the Ambidextrous trait.||||||||
MNTRAIT|Implant Rejection|-15|Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-15 cp) This morph does not accept implants well. At Level 2, the morph cannot accept implants of any kind.||||||||
MNTRAIT|Lacks Manipulators|-10|Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-10 cp) This morph lacks hands or other limbs with a fine manipulation capability. It is a common trait with quadrupeds (as well as certain smart animals). A morph with this trait may not be able to manipulate objects at all or may only be able to do so with a very limited capacity. Some morphs can hold small-sized or smaller tools, weapons, and other objects between their paws or in their mouths, for example, but unless these items have been specifically designed to operate with this morphology, the character will suffer a ?30 modifier to use or may not be able to use them at all (gamemaster discretion). Objects that don't require physical manipulation, such as tools controlled by wireless commands, may be used normally. Some morphs with this trait-particularly quadrupeds-may be unable to hold an object between their paws and move at the same time or may require a SOM x 3 Test to retain their balance while standing upright to hold something.||||||||
MNTRAIT|Lemon|-10|Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-10 cp) This trait is only available for synthetic morphs. This particular morph has some unfixable flaws. Once per game session (preferably at a time that will maximize drama or hilarity), the gamemaster can call for the character to make a MOX x 10 Test (using their current Moxie score). If the character fails, the morph immediately suffers 1 wound resulting from some mechanical failure, electrical glitch, or other breakdown. This wound may be repaired as normal.||||||||
MNTRAIT|Low Gravity Adaptation|-10|Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-10 cp) The morph is adapted to live in low gravity (0.15 g or less) and struggles in higher-gravity environments. Treat the character as suffering the effects of high gravity (p. 199, EP) for every full 0.2 g over 0.15. For example, while the character would operate fine on Luna or Titan, on Mars or Mercury (both 0.38 g) the character would be treated as if suffering the effects of 1 wound. On Venus (0.9 g), the character would be treated as if suffering the effects of 3 wounds. For each of these high gravity increments, also reduce the character's Walking Rate by 1 and their Running Rate by 4. While even low-gravityadapted bodies can sustain the stress of high gravity (over 1 g) for temporary periods, the gamemaster may rule that long-term exposure to higher gravity may result in the accumulation of actual wounds, not just wound effects. This trait may not be applied to morphs with the High-G Adaptation trait.||||||||
MNTRAIT|Low Pain Tolerance|-20|Ego,Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-20 cp) Pain is the character's enemy. The character has a very low threshold for pain tolerance and is more severely impaired when suffering. Increase the modifier for each wound take by an additional -10 (so the character suffers -20 with one wound, -40 with another, and -60 with a third). Additionally, the character suffers a -30 modifier on any test involving pain resistance. This morph version of this trait is only available for biomorphs.||||||||
MNTRAIT|Memory Artifact|-5|Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-5 cp) This particular morph has an anomalous neural structure. As a result, sometimes not all aspects of an ego are properly erased after it has been uploaded and the mind is customarily wiped. This morph has memories from a previous ego that continue to resurface. Once per week, the ego sleeved in the morph must make a MOX x 10 Test. If it fails, certain memories will manifest in the current occupant's mind. This memories are likely to be from emotionally charged or otherwise memorable events in a previous ego's life. The first time the latent memories activate, the ego suffers (1d10 / 2) SV. Additional incidents of memory recall may or may not inflict stress, depending on the memory in question (traumatic ones certainly will), how drastically the memories conflict with the character's personality, and whether or not the character is aware of the source of these memories. The character naturally integrates these memories in with their own, making them a long-term or possibly permanent change that can only be removed with psychotherapy. These memories may of course be useful for plot purposes, as they may include sensitive data, secrets hidden from the public, or information the previous ego does not want spread. Gamemasters should not allow this trait for morphs that will be sleeved for less than a week unless they increase the test frequency from weekly to daily.||||||||
MNTRAIT|Mild Allergy|-5|Morph|NONE|NONE|TRUE|TRUE|(-5 cp) The morph is allergic to a specific chosen allergen (dust, dander, plant pollen, certain chemicals) and suffers mild discomfort when exposed to it (eye irritation, sneezing, difficult breathing). Apply a -10 modifier to all tests while the character remains exposed. This trait is only available for biomorphs.||||||||
MNTRAIT|Neurochemical Imbalance|-5|Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-5 cp) Something about this morph's neurochemistry (or its neurochemical simulators, in the case of pods and synthmorphs) is unbalanced. Egos that sleeve into this morph struggle with a strong, almost overwhelming emotion: sadness, despair, frustration, loneliness, manic intensity, anxiety, euphoria, and so on. The strength of this emotion may ebb and wane, but it is omnipresent enough to have a consistent impact on the character's mood and personality. This imposed emotion does not affect the character's abilities, but it should be taken into effect for roleplaying purposes. The emotion may be quelled with endocrine control implants (but not emotional dampers) or temporarily overcome via a Psychosurgery Test (for biomorphs) or Hardware: Robotics Test (for synthmorphs). Specific drugs may also reduce the effect, based on the particular aptitude affected. Despite these efforts, the emotion will return in 1d10 days.||||||||
MNTRAIT|No Cortical Stack|-15|Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-15 cp) The morph lacks the cortical stack that is common to morphs of its type. This means the character cannot be resleeved from the cortical stack if the character dies, they can only be resleeved from a standard backup. This trait is not available for flats.||||||||
MNTRAIT|Planned Obsolescence|-5|Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-5 cp) The morph is a hypercorp model that requires periodic GSP (Genetic Service Pack) therapy. For every three months of game time, the character must spend credits equal to 10% the cost of the morph on GSP upgrades. If they fail to do so, the morph's SOM is reduced by 5 until the character gets their GSP therapy. These penalties are cumulative over time (at 6 months, 9 months, etc.), but getting GSP therapy once removes all penalties. The character suffers no SOM loss if the majority of a given 3 month period was spent in hibernation, in a healing vat, or in some other form of metabolic suspension. The SOM reduction is due to low level neural degradation, minor tumors, joint pain, and other problems that crop up and express later as hypercorp genetic designers working on tight budgets and tighter deadlines race to release morph models with extra value-added features. While theoretically over many years this trait would lead to the early death of the morph, in game terms the morph stops accruing penalties when its SOM is reduced to 5. The character regains their normal SOM score if they resleeve. This trait is only available to biomorphs (including uplifts and pods). ||||||||
MNTRAIT|Proprietary Tech|-10|Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-10 cp) This trait is only available to synthmorphs. This morph was built to non-standard specifications, so that normal tools and software do not properly work on this morph. This is a conscious design decision by the manufacturer of the morph and is often used as a means of control. By limiting access to repair and modifications, the morph is dependent on the manufacturer. Highly skilled technicians can work around these barriers, but it impedes work. Standard repair and diagnostic tools like repair spray and fixer nanoswarms do not work on this morph, except for manufacturer-approved brands. Characters with Hardware: Robotics can repair or modify the morph but at a ?20 modifier.||||||||
MNTRAIT|Psi Vulnerability|-10|Ego,Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-10 cp) Something about the character's mind makes them particularly vulnerable to psi attack. They suffer a -10 modifier when resisting such attacks. The morph version of this trait may only be taken by biomorphs.||||||||
MNTRAIT|Reduced Size|-10|Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-10 cp) This trait reduces the size of an existing morph model from either large to medium or medium to small (morphs may only be reduced once). Morphs shrunk to a medium size lose the effects of the Large Size trait (next page) and 10 points of Durability. Morphs reduced to a small size gain the effects of the Small Size trait (p. 95) and lose 5 points of Durability. Durability reductions also effect Wound Threshold and Death Rating per normal. Reducing a morph may affect other changes at the gamemaster's discretion.||||||||
MNTRAIT|Severe Allergy (common)|-20|Morph|NONE|NONE|TRUE|TRUE|(-20 cp) The morph's biochemistry suffers a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) when it comes into contact (touched, inhaled, or ingested) with a specific allergen. The allergen may be common (dust, dander, plant pollen, certain foods, latex) or uncommon (certain drugs, insect stings). The player and gamemaster should agree on an allergen that fits the game. If exposed to the allergen, the character breaks into hives, has difficulty to breathing (-30 modifier to all actions), and must make a DUR Test or go into anaphylactic shock (dying of respiratory failure in 2d10 minutes unless medical care is applied). This trait is only available to biomorphs.||||||||
MNTRAIT|Severe Allergy (uncommon)|-10|Morph|NONE|NONE|TRUE|TRUE|(-10 cp) The morph's biochemistry suffers a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) when it comes into contact (touched, inhaled, or ingested) with a specific allergen. The allergen may be common (dust, dander, plant pollen, certain foods, latex) or uncommon (certain drugs, insect stings). The player and gamemaster should agree on an allergen that fits the game. If exposed to the allergen, the character breaks into hives, has difficulty to breathing (-30 modifier to all actions), and must make a DUR Test or go into anaphylactic shock (dying of respiratory failure in 2d10 minutes unless medical care is applied). This trait is only available to biomorphs.||||||||
MNTRAIT|Social Stigma|-10|Ego,Morph|NONE|NONE|TRUE|TRUE|(-10 cp) An unfortunate aspect of the character's background means that they suffer from a stigma in certain social situations. They may be sleeved in a morph viewed with repugnance, be a survivor of the infamous Lost generation, or may be an AGI in a post-Fall society plagued by fear of artificial intelligence. In social situations where the character's nature is known to someone who view that nature with distaste, fear, or repugnance, they suffer a -10 to -30 modifier (gamemaster's discretion) to social skill tests.||||||||
MNTRAIT|Temperature Intolerance (Warm)|-10||NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-10 cp) The morph is adapted for extreme cold and has difficulty dissipating body heat in temperatures tolerated by normal transhumans. When exposed to vacuum or temperatures above 5 C for more than 10 minutes, the character suffers a -10 modifier to all actions. At 10 C, increase the modifier to -20. At temperatures above 25 C, the character may suffer 1d10 DV per hour exposed from overheating, at the gamemaster's discretion. These effects can be nullified by wearing a vacsuit, the application of some sort of cooling system, or returning to a suitably cold environment.||||||||
MNTRAIT|Unattractive - Uplift (Level 1)|-5|Morph|NONE|NONE|TRUE|FALSE|(-5 cp) In a time when good looks are easily purchased, this morph is conspicuously ugly. As unattractiveness is increasingly associated with being poor, backward, or genetically defective, responses to a lack of good looks range from distaste to horror. The character suffers a -10 modifier on social tests. This trait is only available to uplifts. This modifier is only effective against characters with your specific uplift background (i.e., neo-avians, neo-hominids, etc.).||||||||
MNTRAIT|Unattractive - Uplift (Level 2)|-10|Morph|NONE|NONE|TRUE|FALSE|(-10 cp) In a time when good looks are easily purchased, this morph is conspicuously ugly.

MNTRAIT|Unattractive (Level 1)|-10|Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-10 cp) In a time when good looks are easily purchased, this morph is conspicuously ugly. As unattractiveness is increasingly associated with being poor, backward, or genetically defective, responses to a lack of good looks range from distaste to horror. The character suffers a -10 modifier on social tests. Only biomorphs may take this trait. This modifier does not apply to interactions with xenomorphs or those with the infolife or uplift backgrounds.||||||||
MNTRAIT|Unattractive (Level 2)|-20|Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-20 cp) In a time when good looks are easily purchased, this morph is conspicuously ugly. As unattractiveness is increasingly associated with being poor, backward, or genetically defective, responses to a lack of good looks range from distaste to horror.

This modifier does not apply to interactions with xenomorphs or those with the infolife or uplift backgrounds.||||||||
MNTRAIT|Unattractive (Level 3)|-30|Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-30 cp) In a time when good looks are easily purchased, this morph is conspicuously ugly. As unattractiveness is increasingly associated with being poor, backward, or genetically defective, responses to a lack of good looks range from distaste to horror. The character suffers a -30 modifier on social tests. Only biomorphs may take this trait. This modifier does not apply to interactions with xenomorphs or those with the infolife or uplift backgrounds.||||||||
MNTRAIT|Uncanny Valley|-10|Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-10 cp) There is a point where synthetic human looks become uncannily realistic and human-seeming, but they remain just different enough that their looks seem creepy or even repulsive a phenomenon called the uncanny valley. Morphs whose looks fall into this range suffer a -10 modifier on social skill tests when dealing with humans. This modifier does not apply to interactions with xenomorphs or those with the infolife or uplift backgrounds.||||||||
MNTRAIT|Uncontrollable Urge|-10|Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-10 cp) The ego or morph has an overwhelming primal drive that is not properly filtered by the brain, such as the urge for hunting, hiding food, mating, marking territory, driving off competitors (or, for the rare synthmorph, cleaning, serving, or shutting down when not in use), and so on. When presented with triggering stimuli, the character must pass a WIL x 3 Test to resist acting out the compulsion immediately. While resisting the compulsion, the character suffers a -10 to all actions. Uncontrollable drives are poorly received in most circles. This trait is most common among uplifts.||||||||
MNTRAIT|Weak Grip|-10||NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-10 cp) This trait is only available to neo-avian and neo-pig morphs. The physiology of this particular morph is flawed in that the opposable digits on the hands are not fully formed or operational. A character in this morph loses their damage bonus in melee attacks and suffers a ?10 modifier on subdual tests (p. 204, EP) and any other tests involving their grip, hand strength, or ability to hold on.||||||||
MNTRAIT|Weak Immune System (Level 1)|-10|Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-10 cp) The morph's immune system is susceptible to diseases, drugs, and toxins. At Level 1, apply a -10 modifier whenever making a test to resist infection or the effects of a toxin or drug.||||||||
MNTRAIT|Weak Immune System (Level 2)|-20|Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-20 cp) The morph's immune system is susceptible to diseases, drugs, and toxins. At Level 2, apply a -20 modifier whenever making a test to resist infection or the effects of a toxin or drug.||||||||
#MPTRAIT|Alien Biochemistry|0|Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|It is an impressive feat that creatures that evolved on separate worlds with different biochemistries are now being transformed into pods by transhuman geneticists. In fact, the biochemistries of these creatures are far less understood than that of transhumans. What this means is that drugs, chemicals, bioware augmentations, and cybernetic implants may have unpredictable effects on the pod.

It is also possible that the pod may be burdened with unusual biological problems inherent to its species, such as bizarre gastrointestinal issues, hacking up hairballs, respiratory distress, or an alien version of leukemia. Gamemasters are encouraged to be inventive. Morphs with alien biochemistry count as exotic and inflict -30 modifiers to Alienation and Integrity Tests (p. 272, EP). This trait is only available to pods created from alien life.||||||||
MPTRAIT|Coronal Adaptation|30|Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(30 cp) For biomorphs, this radical alteration enables the subject's metabolism to live off solar energy, using medichines to repair radiation damage. This same metabolism also generates powerful electromagnetic fields that protect the character from the intense temperatures and radiation in the coronal environment and even enable the character to sail the solar winds. Morphs with this adaptation cannot survive outside the coronal environment (or similar environments) for more than a few days without extensive medical support. Coronal adaptation can only be applied to morphs that also have medichines (p. 308, EP).  For synthmorphs, this adaptation restructures the morph's composition with heat-resistant materials capable of surviving superheated plasma and shielded against radiation. The shell is also equipped with refractive metamaterials and a perfectly mirrored surface, giving it an albedo of nearly one. The reflective surface protects the wearer from well over 99% of the radiant energy that falls upon it, but a powerful cooling system and extensive radiation shielding are required for the minuscule percentage of energy that slips through. Generated electromagnetic fields also protect the morph and enable propulsion along solar magnetic lines. This adaptation provides a +10 modifier to the biomorph's Free Fall skill tests in the presence of strong electromagnetic fields. It also provides 10 points of Energy armor against heat and electromagnetic-based attacks (such as lasers, microwaves, and plasma weapons, but not explosions). ||||||||
MPTRAIT|Drug Exception|10|Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(10 cp) The character or morph has an unusual resistance to addiction for one particular biological or chemical drug (but not nanodrugs or narcoalgorithms). Addiction Tests for using that drug or resisting an addiction craving are made with a +20 modifier.Furthermore, the character halves the penalty for minor and moderate addiction to that drug, but still suffers full penalties from major addiction.||||||||
MPTRAIT|Eidetic Memory|10|Ego,Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(10 cp) Much like a computer, the character has perfect memory recall. They can remember anything they have sensed, often even from a single glance. This works the same as the eidetic memory implant.||||||||
MPTRAIT|Emotive|0|Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(0 cp) Synthmorph Only. The emotive circuits for this morph are exceptional. Kinesics Tests made against the morph suffer only a ?10 modifier, rather than the usual ?30 for synthmorphs. This is useful when non-vocally emoting to friends, and not so great when trying to hide your intentions from others.||||||||
MPTRAIT|Enlarged Size|10|Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(10 cp) This trait increases the size of an existing morph model from either small to medium or medium to large (morphs may only be enlarged once). Morphs enlarged to a medium size lose the effects of the Small Size trait (p. 95) and gain 5 points of Durability. Morphs enlarged to a large size gain the effects of the Large Size trait (p. 94) and 10 points of Durability. Durability increases also effect Wound Threshold and Death Rating as normal. Enlarging a morph may affect other changes at the gamemaster's discretion. For example, morphs that relied on their small size for flight may lose that capability or suffer modifiers.||||||||
MPTRAIT|High-Temperature Operation|10|Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(10 cp) This morph has been designed to operate only in high-temperature environments, enabling them to withstand temperatures up to 1,000 C. This morph loses 1 point of COO for every 5 minutes it spends at temperatures lower than 250 C, and 1 point of COO for every minute that it spends below 150 C. When its COO equals zero the morph becomes completely immobile. This same penalty is applied to all COO-based skill rolls. The morph's cyberbrain and mesh access still work in these circumstances, but the morph cannot physically move under its own power. Even if placed back in higher temperatures, if it was previously reduced to total immobility, the morph halves its COO and SOM (round down) until it has been serviced. This trait may only be applied to synthmorphs. It provides 5 points of Energy armor against heat-based attacks (such as lasers, microwaves, and plasma weapons, but not explosions). ||||||||
MPTRAIT|Improved Immune System (Level 1)|10|Ego,Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(10 cp) The morph's immune system is robust and more resistant to diseases, drugs, and toxins even more than basic bio-mods. At Level 1, apply a +10 modifier whenever making a test to resist infection or the effects of a toxin or drug. This trait is only available to biomorphs.||||||||
MPTRAIT|Improved Immune System (Level 2)|20|Ego,Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(20 cp) The morph's immune system is robust and more resistant to diseases, drugs, and toxins even more than basic bio-mods. At Level 1, apply a +20 modifier whenever making a test to resist infection or the effects of a toxin or drug. This trait is only available to biomorphs.||||||||
MPTRAIT|Innocuous|10|Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(10 cp) In an age when exotic appearances and good looks are commonplace, the morph's look is surprisingly bland and undistinguished, in that cookie cutter sort of way. The character's physical looks are so mundane that others have a hard time picking them out of a crowd, describing their appearance, or otherwise remembering physical details. Apply a -10 modifier to all tests made to spot, describe, or remember the character. This modifier does not apply to psi or mesh searches.||||||||
#MPTRAIT|Large Size|0|Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|The morph is significantly larger than a normal transhuman, which has its advantages and disadvantages. The character counts as a large target in combat, granting all enemies a +10 bonus on attack rolls against the character. Their mass works against them; double the damage from falling or collisions after armor is applied. The character gains the reach advantage (p. 204, EP) against standard-size targets (double this against small targets) and can also wield two-handed weapons in one hand without penalty. At the gamemaster's discretion, the character may suffer a ?20 modifier when handling small items, assuming they come equipped with no fine manipulators. Naturally, they may also have difficulty with armor, clothing, and other gear manufactured for smaller morphs, as well as the cramped confines of many habitats. This trait applies to morphs that are inherently large. To apply it to existing morphs with a smaller baseline, use the Enlarged Size trait (p. 83). The following existing morphs are considered to have the Large Size trait: fenrir, neo-beluga, neo-orca, q-morph, sundiver. The following existing bots and vehicles are also considered large: dwarf, flux car, flying car, ground car, hyperdense exoskeleton, Mars buggy, portable plane, rocket buggy, skimmer.||||||||
MPTRAIT|Limber (Level 1)|10|Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(10 cp) The morph is especially flexible and supple, capable of graceful contortions and interesting positions. At Level 1, the character can smoke with their toes, do the splits, and squeeze into small, cramped spaces. This trait is only available to biomorphs.||||||||
MPTRAIT|Limber (Level 2)|20|Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(20 cp) The morph is especially flexible and supple, capable of graceful contortions and interesting positions. At Level 2, they are double-jointed escape artists. Each level provides a +10 modifier to escaping from bonds, fitting into narrow confines, and other acts relying on contortion or flexibility. This trait is only available to biomorphs.||||||||
MPTRAIT|Natural Immunity|10|Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(10 cp) The morph has a natural immunity to a specific drug, disease, or toxin. When afflicted with that specific chemical, poison, or pathogen, the character remains unaffected. At the gamemaster's discretion, this immunity may not apply to certain agents. It may not be applied to nanodrugs or nanotoxins. This trait is only available to biomorphs.||||||||
#MPTRAIT|Non-Human Biochemistry|0|Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|Biomorphs (including pods) with this trait are developed from non-human (but still mammalian) species or have been genetically modified enough that they are substantially different from humans. Though they are often medically similar to humans, there may be notable differences, and certain common drugs and medical treatments may not work on the morph or may have drastically different results. Though most non-human morphs are developed without allergies, some are occasionally overlooked. Common augmentations may not be available for this morph or may need extra time to prepare. Medicine: Uplift or Medicine: Exotic Biomorph is used to medically treat these morphs. Apply a ?10 modifier to any other Medicine skills used to heal or augment the morph; gamemasters should also feel free to increase this modifier to ?20 or ?30 and/or adjust the timeframe based on the character's condition and resources available to the medical staff. Non-anthropomorphic morphs with this trait count as exotic and inflict ?30 modifiers to Alienation and Integration Tests (p. 272, EP). This trait is only available to morphs created from non-human biochemistries. The following existing morphs are considered to have the Non-Human Biochemistry trait: aquanaut, hypergibbon, neanderthal, neo-beluga, neo-dolphin, neo-hominid (bonobo, chimp, orangutan, and gorilla), neo-orca, neo-pig, neo-porpoise, neo-whale, selkie, surya.||||||||
#MPTRAIT|Non-Mammalian Biochemistry|0|Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|Biomorphs (including pods) with this trait are developed from non-mammalian biologies. The state of medicine for these morphs is often not quite as advanced as it is for humans, and certain common drugs and medical treatments may not work on the morph or may have drastically different results. Though most non-mammalian morphs are developed without allergies, some are occasionally overlooked. Common augmentations may not be available for this morph or may need extra time to prepare. Medicine: Uplift or Medicine: Exotic Biomorph is used to medically treat these morphs. Apply a ?20 modifier to any other Medicine skills used to heal or augment the morph; gamemasters should also feel free to increase this modifier to ?30 and/or adjust the timeframe based on the resources available to the medical staff. Morphs with this trait count as exotic and inflict ?30 modifiers to Alienation and Integration Tests (p. 272, EP). This trait is only available to morphs created from non-mammalian biochemistries. The following existing morphs are considered to have the Non-Mammalian Biochemistry trait: chickcharnie, hulder, neoavian, novacrab, octomorph, ripwing, salamander.||||||||
MPTRAIT|Pain Tolerance (Level 1)|10|Ego,Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(10 cp) The character has a high threshold for pain tolerance and is better at ignoring the effects of pain on their abilities and concentration. Level 1 allows them to ignore the 10 modifier from 1 wound. This trait is only available for biomorphs.||||||||
MPTRAIT|Pain Tolerance (Level 2)|20|Ego,Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(20 cp) The character has a high threshold for pain tolerance and is better at ignoring the effects of pain on their abilities and concentration. Level 2 allows them to ignore the 10 modifiers from 2 wounds. This trait is only available for biomorphs.||||||||
MPTRAIT|Psi Chameleon|10|Ego,Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(10 cp) The characters mental state is naturally resistant to psi sensing. Apply a 10 modifier to any attempts to locate or detect the character via psi sleights.||||||||
MPTRAIT|Psi Defense (Level 1)|10|Ego,Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(10 cp) The characters mind is inherently resistant to mental attacks. At Level 1, apply a +10 modifier to all defense tests made against psi attacks.||||||||
MPTRAIT|Psi Defense (Level 2)|20|Ego,Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(20 cp) At Level 2, apply an additional +10 modifier to all defense tests made against psi attacks.||||||||
MPTRAIT|Skill Artifact (Level 1)|10|Morph|NONE|NONE|TRUE|FALSE|(10 cp) The morph has latent skills stored in muscle memory or as higher-level data that refuses to be erased. This is especially common for exotic or alien morphs. At level 1, the morph has a single Active skill at a rating of 30 (plus aptitude) or a single Knowledge skill at 40 (plus aptitude). Level 2 adds a second skill. This new skill suppresses the ego's pre-existing rating in that skill, similar to a skillware system. These skills cannot be changed or turned off as long as the ego is sleeved in that morph.||||||||
MPTRAIT|Skill Artifact (Level 2)|20|Morph|NONE|NONE|TRUE|FALSE|(20 cp) The morph has latent skills stored in muscle memory or as higher-level data that refuses to be erased. This is especially common for exotic or alien morphs. At level 1, the morph has a single Active skill at a rating of 30 (plus aptitude) or a single Knowledge skill at 40 (plus aptitude). Level 2 adds a second skill. This new skill suppresses the ego's pre-existing rating in that skill, similar to a skillware system. These skills cannot be changed or turned off as long as the ego is sleeved in that morph.||||||||
#MPTRAIT|Small Size|0|Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|The morph is significantly smaller than a normal transhuman, roughly child-sized. The character counts as a small target in combat; apply a ?10 modifier to attacks against the character. Standard-size opponents have a reach advantage against the character and large and very large opponents will have double this advantage. The character may also, at the gamemaster's discretion, suffer a ?20 modifier when handling medium-sized gear or two-handed weapons that have not been modified for their size. They may also have difficulty with armor, gear, and so on manufactured for larger morphs. Small morphs have an aptitude maximum for SOM of 25. This trait applies to morphs that are inherently small. To apply it to existing morphs with a larger baseline, use the Reduced Size trait (p. 93). The following existing morphs are considered to have the Small Size trait: dragonfly, flexbot modules, hypergibbon, kite, neo-avian, neotenic, scurrier, spare. The following existing bots/vehicles are considered to have the Small Size trait: bughunter, caretaker, creepy, explorenaut, gnat, manipulator cuff, saucer, spider hand, thumper. The following existing smart animals are considered to have the Small Size trait: aquarium pet, guard dog, police baboon, rust hound, smart cat/dog/hawk/monkey/racoon/rat/wolf, space roach, squidling, swarm cat.||||||||
MPTRAIT|Striking Looks - Uplift (Level 1)|5|Morph|NONE|NONE|TRUE|FALSE|(5 cp) In an age where biosculpting is easy, good looks are both cheap and commonplace. This morph, however, possesses a physical look that can only be described as striking and unusual, but also somehow alluring and fascinating even the gorgeous and chiseled glitterati take notice. On social skill tests where the character's beauty may affect the outcome, they receive a +10 (for Level 1) modifier. This trait is only available to uplifts. This modifier is only effective against characters with your specific uplift background (i.e., neo-avians, neo-hominids, etc.). The one drawback to this trait is that the character is more easily noticed and remembered.||||||||
MPTRAIT|Striking Looks - Uplift (Level 2)|10|Morph|NONE|NONE|TRUE|FALSE|(10 cp) In an age where biosculpting is easy, good looks are both cheap and commonplace. This morph, however, possesses a physical look that can only be described as striking and unusual, but also somehow alluring and fascinating even the gorgeous and chiseled glitterati take notice. On social skill tests where the character's beauty may affect the outcome, they receive a +20 (for Level 2) modifier. This trait is only available to uplifts. This modifier is only effective against characters with your specific uplift background (i.e., neo-avians, neo-hominids, etc.). The one drawback to this trait is that the character is more easily noticed and remembered.||||||||
MPTRAIT|Striking Looks (Level 1)|10|Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(10 cp) In an age where biosculpting is easy, good looks are both cheap and commonplace. This morph, however, possesses a physical look that can only be described as striking and unusual, but also somehow alluring and fascinating even the gorgeous and chiseled glitterati take notice. On social skill tests where the character's beauty may affect the outcome, they receive a +10 (for Level 1) modifier. This modifier is ineffective against xenomorphs or those with the infolife or uplift backgrounds. This trait is only available to biomorphs. The one drawback to this trait is that the character is more easily noticed and remembered.||||||||
MPTRAIT|Striking Looks (Level 2)|20|Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(20 cp) In an age where biosculpting is easy, good looks are both cheap and commonplace. This morph, however, possesses a physical look that can only be described as striking and unusual, but also somehow alluring and fascinating even the gorgeous and chiseled glitterati take notice. On social skill tests where the character's beauty may affect the outcome, they receive a +20 (for Level 2) modifier. This modifier is ineffective against xenomorphs or those with the infolife or uplift backgrounds. This trait is only available to biomorphs. The one drawback to this trait is that the character is more easily noticed and remembered.||||||||
MPTRAIT|Unique Look|0|Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(0 cp) The morph is engineered to stand out in a society with sophisticated cloning and fabrication technology. The exact nature of the unique look varies based on the morph. Some employ proprietary technology secured by DRM in order to prevent others from copying the exact look of the morph. Others are secured by reputation alone-the look of an infamous triad crime boss would never be copied for fear of retribution. Whatever the reason, no one will mistake this morph for someone else. Any attempt to impersonate a morph with this trait suffers a ?30 penalty. Characters with this trait tend to cause extremely positive or negative reactions in social situations. Characters with this trait may gain a positive modifier of up to +30 in certain Social Skill Tests or suffer up to a ?30 penalty on Social Skill Tests, depending on the circumstance. In general, morphs with the Unique Look trait are strongly associated with a particular element of transhuman society, so characters with this trait will become de facto representatives of that element of society and others will treat them accordingly.||||||||
#MPTRAIT|Very Large Size|0|Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|The morph is huge in size, bigger than many vehicles. It counts as a very large target in combat, providing opponents with a +20 modifier to hit. Their mass works against them; triple the damage from falling or collisions after armor is applied. The morph gains the reach advantage (p. 204, EP) against largesized targets; double this bonus against medium and small targets. It can wield two-handed weapons in one hand, but suffers a -20 modifier with medium-sized objects and cannot use small items or smaller, unless they come equipped with fine manipulators. Very large morphs are too big to wear standard clothing and armor and do not fit within the confines of cramped habitats. This trait only applies to morphs that are inherently very large. The following existing morphs are considered to have the Very Large Size trait: neo-whales and surya. The following existing bots and vehicles are considered to have the Very Large Size trait: cargo hauler, crasher truck, deep sea submarine, defense platform, fighter, GEV, interceptor, large jet, lifeboat, maglev train, Martian rover, methane skiff, mobile base, outsystem hover/skimmer, scorcher, siftrunner, small jet, SLOTV, Titanian cargo copter, utility helicopter, Venusian hauler.||||||||
#MPTRAIT|Very Small Size|0|Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|The bot or creature is roughly mouse- or insect-sized. It counts as a very small target in combat; apply a ?30 modifier to attacks against it. Halve the damage from falling or collisions after armor is applied. Smallsize opponents have a reach advantage against it and larger opponents will have double this advantage. The bot/critter suffers a ?20 modifier when handling small-sized gear and cannot use any gear that is larger. It cannolt use standard clothing or armor and is too small to fit a cyberbrain. Very small bots and animals have an aptitude maximum for SOM of 5. This trait only applies to bots and creatures that are inherently very small. The following existing bots and creatures are considered to have the Very Small Size trait: bees/wasps, recon flyer/hopper/snake, sky mote, speck.||||||||
MPTRAIT|Whole Body Apoptosis|0|Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(0 cp) This morph has been genetically programmed to suffer a sudden and lethal massive cellular failure at some point in the future, usually within a given 10 year period, though it is possible to target a specific date, give or take a few months. This modification is favored by bioconservatives that wish to live healthy and die quickly and naturally. The cellular failure takes about 10 minutes to complete, giving the character time to stop what they are doing, send any final messages, or commit any other final acts. This trait may only be applied to biomorphs (including pods). Apoptosis may not be initiated voluntarily.||||||||
NTRAIT|Addiction (Major)|-20|Morph|NONE|NONE|TRUE|TRUE|(-20 cp) Addiction comes in two forms: mental (affecting the ego) and physical (affecting the biomorph). The character or morph is addicted to a drug (p. 317), stimulus (XP), or activity (mesh use) to a degree that impacts the character's physical or mental health. Players and gamemasters should work together to agree on addictions that are appropriate for their game. Addiction comes in three levels of severity: minor, moderate, or major: Major: A character with a major addiction is on the rapid road to ruin. They face cravings every 6 hours, and suffer a -10 DUR penalty as their health is affected. If they fail to get their regular dosage, they suffer a -30 modifier on all actions until they do. If their life hasn't already been ruined by their obsession, it soon will be.||||||||
NTRAIT|Addiction (Minor)|-5|Morph|NONE|NONE|TRUE|TRUE|(-5 cp) Addiction comes in two forms: mental (affecting the ego) and physical (affecting the biomorph). The character or morph is addicted to a drug (p. 317), stimulus (XP), or activity (mesh use) to a degree that impacts the character's physical or mental health. Players and gamemasters should work together to agree on addictions that are appropriate for their game. Addiction comes in three levels of severity: minor, moderate, or major: Minor: A minor addiction is largely kept under control-it does not ruin the character's life, though it may create some difficulties. The character may not even recognize or admit they have a problem. The character must indulge the addiction at least once a week, though they can go for longer without too much difficulty. If they fail to get their weekly dose, they suffer a -10 modifier on all actions until they get their fix.||||||||
NTRAIT|Addiction (Moderate)|-10|Morph|NONE|NONE|TRUE|TRUE|(-10 cp) Addiction comes in two forms: mental (affecting the ego) and physical (affecting the biomorph). The character or morph is addicted to a drug (p. 317), stimulus (XP), or activity (mesh use) to a degree that impacts the character's physical or mental health. Players and gamemasters should work together to agree on addictions that are appropriate for their game. Addiction comes in three levels of severity: minor, moderate, or major: Moderate: A moderate addiction is in full swing. The character obviously has a problem, and must satisfy the addiction at least once a day. If they fail to do so, they may suffer mood swings, compulsive behavior, physical sickness, or other side effects until they indulge their craving. Apply a -20 modifier to all of the character's actions until they get their fix. Additionally, a character with this level of addiction suffers a -5 DUR penalty.||||||||
NTRAIT|Anomalous Mind|-20|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-20 cp) Found almost exclusively in AGIs, uplifts, and the subjects of highly experimental pyschosurgical proce- dures, your mental patterns are dramatically outside the norm of transhumanity. The uniqueness of their mental map makes psychosurgery, routine backup, and resleeving difficult and risky. Any attempts to perform psychosurgery on the character suffer a -10 penalty and automatically cause 1 SV in addition to any other results and regardless of the success or failure of a procedure. Also, backing up and resleeving are not automatic (pp. 268-271, EP) and require active management of the process. Any techni- cian operating the ego bridge during such procedures must succeed on a Psychosurgery Test or the backup/ sleeving attempt will fail.||||||||
NTRAIT|Bad Luck|-30|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-30 cp) Due to some inexplicable cosmic coincidence, things seem to go wrong around the character. The gamemaster is given a pool of Moxie points equal to the character's Moxie stat, which also refreshes at the same rate as the character's Moxie. Only the gamemaster may utilize this Moxie, however, and the purpose is to use it against the character. In other words, the gamemaster can use this bad Moxie to cause the character to automatically fail, flip-flop a roll, and so on. To reflect the black cloud that follows the character, the gamemaster can even use this bad Moxie against the character's friends and allies, when they are doing something with or related to the character, though this should be used sparingly. Gamemasters who might be reluctant to sabotage the character should remember that the player asked for it by purchasing this trait.||||||||
NTRAIT|Beta|-20|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-20 cp) This character is a beta fork of their original self, which for some reason is no longer alive (most likely lost during the Fall). They were created some time ago, so they have grown and overcome most of their original aptitude deficiencies. This character may not have a Moxie higher than 1 and no Active skills higher than 60, nor may they possess the Psi trait. They also have only a limited set of their original self's memories-much of their previous life is simply lost to them. They automatically receive the Edited Memories trait (p. 149, EP), without gaining the bonus CP. Beta forks are, of course, illegal in many jurisdictions, and some consider them less than human (the gamemaster may apply a Social Stigma: Beta trait in appropriate circumstances; again no bonus CP are gained).Note: the restrictions of the trait are not implemented; review your character to ascertain that it is properly constrained to the listed requirements. If you acquired this trait through packs or lifepaths, you may subtract the relevant values and reassign their CP.||||||||
NTRAIT|Black Mark (Level 1)|-10|Ego|NONE|NONE|TRUE|TRUE|(-10 cp) At some point in the character's past, they managed to do something that earned a black mark on their reputation. For some reason, no matter what they do, this black mark cannot be shaken off and continues to haunt their interactions. In game terms, the character picks one faction. Every time they interact with this faction (such as a Networking Test) or with an NPC from this faction (Social Skill Tests) who knows who the character is, they suffer a -10 modifier.||||||||
NTRAIT|Black Mark (Level 2)|-20|Ego|NONE|NONE|TRUE|TRUE|(-20 cp) At some point in the character's past, they managed to do something that earned a black mark on their reputation. For some reason, no matter what they do, this black mark cannot be shaken off and continues to haunt their interactions. In game terms, the character picks one faction. Every time they interact with this faction (such as a Networking Test) or with an NPC from this faction (Social Skill Tests) who knows who the character is, they suffer a -20 modifier.||||||||
NTRAIT|Black Mark (Level 3)|-30|Ego|NONE|NONE|TRUE|TRUE|(-30 cp) At some point in the character's past, they managed to do something that earned a black mark on their reputation. For some reason, no matter what they do, this black mark cannot be shaken off and continues to haunt their interactions. In game terms, the character picks one faction. Every time they interact with this faction (such as a Networking Test) or with an NPC from this faction (Social Skill Tests) who knows who the character is, they suffer a -30 modifier.||||||||
NTRAIT|Botched Merge|-15|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-15 cp) In the past, the character suffered a serious complication during an attempt to merge a fork that caused irreparable damage to their ego map, leaving them with a weaker grip on their memories and own identity. For some reason-perhaps due to irreproducible memories or information that would otherwise be lost, moral conviction, or the lack of any prior backup states to re-instance-the decision was made to carry on with a damaged mind. Now, high-stress situations can cause periods of disso- ciation, amnesia, and body alienation. Whenever the character takes stress damage, they must succeed on an INT x 3 Test or immediately enter a dissociative state where they feel disconnected from their body, lose some awareness of the events around them, and/ or forget certain information, memories, or skills. In this state they suffer a -10 penalty on all tests. The dissociative state persists for one minute or for the duration of a derangement if one is acquired due to trauma.||||||||
NTRAIT|Botched Uplift|-30|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-30 cp) (Uplifts Only) This trait is only available to uplifts. Although possessed of a rough self-awareness and the trap- pings of sapience, your mental development is flawed. Despite the best efforts of your creators and teachers, you cannot ever fully overcome your mental limita- tions and serious social awkwardness. Even psycho- surgery is unlikely to fix you. You have an aptitude maximum of 10 for both COG or SAV. You have difficulty keeping up with others in complex social situations and are likely highly reliant on your muse to organize your life and coach you through your daily affairs. Whoever does interact with you likely treats you with either contempt or pity, as your diffi- culties are apparent to anyone who has more than the briefest exchanges with you.||||||||
NTRAIT|Combat Paralysis|-20|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-20 cp) The character has an unfortunate habit of freezing in combat or stressful situations, like a deer caught in headlights. Anytime violence breaks out around the character, or they are surprised, the character must make a Willpower Test in order to act or respond in any way. If they fail the test, they lose their action and simply stand there, remaining incapable of reacting to the situation.||||||||
NTRAIT|Curbed Intelligence|-10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-10 cp) (AGIs Only) Fearful of AGIs that might develop into seed AIs like the TITANs, some developers have programmed extra safeguards and precautions into AGI mind- states to limit their intelligence. The aptitude maximum for COG for this AGI character is 15. Note: this trait is not enforced; verify that your character meets aptitude maximum constraints.||||||||
NTRAIT|Data Footprint|-10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-10 cp) The character is particularly sloppy about keeping a lid on their daily living, online, and social networking interactions, leaving a larger data footprint than usual in the public eye. Apply a +10 modifier to any Research Tests to gather information on the character or track them online (see Scanning, Tracking, and Monitoring, p. 251, EP) and any Networking Tests to ascertain the character's networking interactions (see Keeping It Quiet, p. 288, EP).||||||||
NTRAIT|Debt (Level 1)|-10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-10 cp) The character is in debt to a loan shark or powerful organization that demands regular payments. The debt may be the result of a legitimate loan or the character may be a victim of extortion. Either way, the character is expected to pay, with an interest rate that is far above standard (and possibly illegal), and the creditor organization will not take no for an answer. The approximate level of debt is equal to the following amount: Level 1: 20,000 credits (plus 1d10 x 500 credits in weekly interest; Level 2: 40,000 credits (plus 2d10 x 500 credits in weekly interest; Level 3: 60,000 credits (plus 3d10 x 500 credits in weekly interest. Each week the character is expected to make a payment on the debt equal to the weekly interest. Failure to do so will cause the creditor organization to retaliate, which can take any number of forms. Hypercorp creditors may lower the character's rep by publicly declaring them a deadbeat while criminal syndicates may send ego hunters to extract full payment. Many organizations employ debt collectors that know how to get money from reluctant debtors one way or the other. If the character completely reneges on this debt, they gain the Black Mark (Level 2) and Enemy traits. Characters may be given the option of working off their weekly interest payment-or even their entire debt-by performing a job or other favor for the creditor organization. Generally, this will be a high risk mission for which the organization does not want to use its own personnel, such as retrieval of data from an exsurgent-infested abandoned habitat or assassinating the head of a Martian crime syndicate. The higher the debt is, the more dangerous or difficult the mission will be.||||||||
NTRAIT|Debt (Level 2)|-20|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-20 cp) The character is in debt to a loan shark or powerful organization that demands regular payments.

If the character completely reneges on this debt, they gain the Black Mark (Level 2) and Enemy traits. Characters may be given the option of working off their weekly interest payment-or even their entire debt-by performing a job or other favor for the creditor organization. Generally, this will be a high risk mission for which the organization does not want to use its own personnel, such as retrieval of data from an exsurgent-infested abandoned habitat or assassinating the head of a Martian crime syndicate. The higher the debt is, the more dangerous or difficult the mission will be.||||||||
NTRAIT|Debt (Level 3)|-20|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-20 cp) The character is in debt to a loan shark or powerful organization that demands regular payments. The debt may be the result of a legitimate loan or the character may be a victim of extortion. Either way, the character is expected to pay, with an interest rate that is far above standard (and possibly illegal), and the creditor organization will not take no for an answer. The approximate level of debt is equal to the following amount: Level 1: 20,000 credits (plus 1d10 x 500 credits in weekly interest; Level 2: 40,000 credits (plus 2d10 x 500 credits in weekly interest; Level 3: 60,000 credits (plus 3d10 x 500 credits in weekly interest. Each week the character is expected to make a payment on the debt equal to the weekly interest. Failure to do so will cause the creditor organization to retaliate, which can take any number of forms. Hypercorp creditors may lower the character's rep by publicly declaring them a deadbeat while criminal syndicates may send ego hunters to extract full payment. Many organizations employ debt collectors that know how to get money from reluctant debtors one way or the other.

The higher the debt is, the more dangerous or difficult the mission will be.||||||||
NTRAIT|Deferred Indenture (Level 1)|-5|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-5 cp) Due to a prior contract or sentence, this character has a pending indenture that has yet to be redeemed. The character is legally obligated to perform whatever work is asked of them to repay their debt. At Level 1, the value of the indenture is equivalent to 5,000 credits or a Level 4 favor. At Level 2, it is worth 20,000 credits or a Level 5 favor. At Level 3, the indenture is worth 40,000 credits or two Level 5 favors. If the indenture is not honored when called in, the character will be subject to the legal consequences, up to and including pursuit by law enforcement and additional criminal penalties from the originating jurisdiction. Gamemasters and players should outline the circumstances that led to the establishment of the indenture.||||||||
NTRAIT|Deferred Indenture (Level 2)|-15|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-15 cp) Due to a prior contract or sentence, this character has a pending indenture that has yet to be redeemed. The character is legally obligated to perform whatever work is asked of them to repay their debt. At Level 1, the value of the indenture is equivalent to 5,000 credits or a Level 4 favor. At Level 2, it is worth 20,000 credits or a Level 5 favor. At Level 3, the indenture is worth 40,000 credits or two Level 5 favors. If the indenture is not honored when called in, the character will be subject to the legal consequences, up to and including pursuit by law enforcement and additional criminal penalties from the originating jurisdiction. Gamemasters and players should outline the circumstances that led to the establishment of the indenture.||||||||
NTRAIT|Deferred Indenture (Level 3)|-20|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-20 cp) Due to a prior contract or sentence, this character has a pending indenture that has yet to be redeemed. The character is legally obligated to perform whatever work is asked of them to repay their debt. At Level 1, the value of the indenture is equivalent to 5,000 credits or a Level 4 favor. At Level 2, it is worth 20,000 credits or a Level 5 favor. At Level 3, the indenture is worth 40,000 credits or two Level 5 favors. If the indenture is not honored when called in, the character will be subject to the legal consequences, up to and including pursuit by law enforcement and additional criminal penalties from the originating jurisdiction. Gamemasters and players should outline the circumstances that led to the establishment of the indenture.||||||||
NTRAIT|Dependent|-5|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-5 cp) This character has a dependent-a child, a disabled family member, or even a much-loved but needy smart animal pet. Though the character can leave their ward's care in the hands of a fork or others, they must occasionally attend to the dependent's needs and may sometimes be forced to bring the dependent with them. The player and gamemaster should work out the specifics of the dependent NPC together; this NPC should have no skills or abilities of value to the player character. The dependent should be a potential vulnerability for the character that enemies or rivals could exploit.||||||||
NTRAIT|Divergent Personality|-10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-10 cp) Something about this character makes their forks diverge from their core personality more quickly than usual. When attempting a merge, treat the fork's time apart as if it were one step lower on the Merging table (p. 275, EP). For example, a fork that is absent under an hour is treated as if it were away for 1-4 hours. Characters with this trait may not take the multi- tasking implant; the continual forking and merging is too stressful on their mind.||||||||
NTRAIT|Domineering|-10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-10 cp) (Uplifts Only) This trait is only available to uplifts and is most common among neo-hominids. The character retains pre-sapient neurological urges to gain social status via dominance. The character must make a WIL x 2 Test to use Persuasion skill in any situation where they can safely deploy Intimidation skill instead. Additionally, they must make a WIL x 3 Test to avoid responding to acts of intimidation with threat displays or violence, though such violence need not be lethal (note that they will still back down if someone successfully uses Intimidation skill on them). Since the evolutionary purpose of dominance structures is to minimize conflict, domineering uplifts prefer to surround themselves with submissives and will avoid entering situations where they know their dominance might be challenged. Such domineering characters often suffer poor reputations in modern transhuman reputation networks. They may not start with a rep score higher than 40 in any rep network other than Guanxi. (Note: this constraint is not enforced; verify that your character meets this requirement.)||||||||
NTRAIT|Drug Fiend|-10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-10 cp) The character or morph has a weak resistance to addiction. Addiction Tests (including attempts to resist addiction cravings) are made with a -20 modifier.||||||||
NTRAIT|Edited Memories|-10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-10 cp) At some point in the character's past, the character had certain memories strategically removed or otherwise lost to them. This may have been done to intentionally forget an unpleasant or shameful experience or to make a break with the past. The memory may also have been lost by an unexpected death (with no recent backup), or it may have been erased against the character's will. Whatever the case, the memory should bear some importance, and there should exist either evidence of what happened or NPCs who know the full story. This is a tool the gamemaster can use to haunt the character at some future point with ghosts from their past.||||||||
NTRAIT|Emotive Blindness|-10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-10 cp) (AGIs and Uplifts Only) This trait is only available to AGIs and uplifts. This character has difficulty reading the finer points of social cues, body language, expressions, emoting, and so forth for any transhuman outside of its own species. Apply a -10 modifier to Kinesics Tests used against anyone not of the same species as the character.||||||||
NTRAIT|Enemy|-10|Ego|NONE|NONE|TRUE|TRUE|(-10 cp) At some point in their past, the character made an enemy for life who continues to haunt them. The gamemaster and player should work out the details on this enmity, and the gamemaster should use the enemy as an occasional threat, surprise, and hindrance.||||||||
NTRAIT|Errant Fork|-10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-10 cp) Whether through conscious action or a freak occurrence, you are not the only you out there. An alpha fork of yourself exists and has decided to pursue its own path. Though this fork is not necessarily an enemy, it does have its own agenda and interests that sometimes run counter to your own. There may be legal issues involved, such as competing claims over who is the original alpha and therefore has rights to any property (or in some jurisdictions, the right to exist). There may be social awkwardness, as the division between you and your alpha forced you to compete over your friends, family, or even lovers. Though the alpha fork began with the same aptitudes, skills, traits, rep, and so on as yourself, it has diverged and begun to develop as a separate character, controlled by the gamemaster. Other complications in the relationship between these alphas should exist, enough that the other alpha should serve as an occasional hindrance or surprise. The alphas may, for example, have a strong rivalry going over their shared field of expertise or may simply feel a need to prove themselves better than the other.||||||||
NTRAIT|Faulty Education|-10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-10 cp) Not everyone receives the same quality of education and many are taught incorrect things. Some children, for example, are raised with an ideologically driven system that prizes obedience over truth and accuracy-something still common in certain Jovian, brinker, and religious communities. Others, like many infugees, isolates, and zeroed indentures, only haveaccess to substandard or obsolete reference material. No matter the cause, the character thinks they know far more than they really do. Once per session, the gamemaster may intentionally mislead the character when giving them the results of a Knowledge Skill Test or otherwise detailing some aspect of the setting or a social interaction, depending on the character's background. This misinformation represents the char-cter's faulty understanding of the topic at hand and should be roleplayed appropriately, even if the player knows that their character is mistaken.||||||||
NTRAIT|Frail Sanity (Level 1)|-10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-10 cp) This ego's mind is not as resilient as others. Its Lucidity is reduced by 5 per level. This also reduces Trauma Threshold by 1 or 2, respectively. (Note: Not yet implemented - adjust manually).||||||||
NTRAIT|Frail Sanity (Level 2)|-20|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-20 cp) This ego's mind is not as resilient as others. Its Lucidity is reduced by 5 per level. This also reduces Trauma Threshold by 1 or 2, respectively. (Note: Not yet implemented - adjust manually).||||||||
NTRAIT|Hoarder|-10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-10 cp) With the limitations on living space and need for resource management in all but the wealthiest habs, most transhumans are used to living with a minimal number of personal possessions. The flexibility and multi-purpose nature of most objects and availability of information, entertainment, and communication over digital or VR services all allow this to work well, but hoarders have a psychological compul- sion to keep things that they don't need and serve no purpose. Particularly common among corvid uplifts and some Fall survivors that lost everything, characters with this trait have a hard time giving away or disposing of things. Unless their behavior is somehow managed, they will accumulate over- whelming collections of junk. Each day, the character must make a WIL x 3 Test to keep their compulsion under control. If they fail, they will keep any objects they would normally throw away or recycle (food packaging, drink bulbs, broken or useless objects like dead ectos, ammunition clips, and the like) and must acquire one new item that day; all of those items will be added to their hoard. Hoarders can force themselves to ignore this compulsion for a day by taking one point of stress damage. If they ever attempt to clean out their hoard voluntarily, or if the hoard is significantly reduced (by catastrophe or by hab maintenance workers forcibly removing it), the character takes (1d10 / 2) + 2 SV.||||||||
NTRAIT|Identifiable Quirk|-10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-10 cp) Transhumans may be able to switch bodies and travel the entire solar system to start a new life, but some things can't be left behind. The character has a unique behavioral quirk that makes identification easy, no matter the morph in which they are sleeved. Attempts to identify this character through Kinesics or similar skills gain a +10 bonus. This quirk could be a nervous twitch of the lips, distinct accent, noticeable laugh, or unusual gait. The character suffers a -30modifier to all Impersonation Tests against targets aware of the character's quirk.||||||||
NTRAIT|Identity Crisis|-10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-10 cp) The character's ego has trouble adapting itself to the changed look of a new morph they are stuck with the mental image of their original body, and simply do not grow accustomed to their new face(s). As a result, the character has difficulty identifying themselves in the mirror, photos, surveillance feeds, etc. They frequently forget the look and shape of their current morph, acting inappropriately, describing themselves by their original body, forgetting to duck when walking through doorways, etc. This is primarily a roleplaying trait, but the gamemaster may apply appropriate modifiers (usually -10) to tests affected by this inability to adapt.||||||||
NTRAIT|Illiterate|-10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-10 cp) The character knows how to speak, but has difficulty reading or writing. Due to the entoptic-saturated and icon-driven nature of transhuman society, they are able to get by quite comfortably with this handicap. Reduce the character's Language skills by half (round down) whenever reading or writing.||||||||
NTRAIT|Immortality Blues|-10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-10 cp) The character has lived so long over 100 years they're bored with life and now have difficulty motivating themselves. They were old when longevity treatments first became available, survived the Fall, and continue to soldier onward though they find it increasingly harder to care, take interest in things around them, or fear final death. The character only receives half the Moxie and Rez Points award for completing motivational goals. This trait may not be purchased by characters with the infolife or uplift backgrounds.||||||||
NTRAIT|Impaired Balance (Level 1)|-10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-10 cp) This trait is only available to neo-pigs. This uplift's brain has not been fully adapted to the neo-pig's bipedal stance and still suffers occasional difficulties with balance. The character suffers a ?10 modifier to any Climbing, Freerunning, or similar test involving balance or upright movement.||||||||
NTRAIT|Impaired Balance (Level 2)|-20|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-10 cp) This trait is only available to neo-pigs. This uplift's brain has not been fully adapted to the neo-pig's bipedal stance and still suffers occasional difficulties with balance. The character suffers a ?20 modifier to any Climbing, Freerunning, or similar test involving balance or upright movement.||||||||
NTRAIT|Impaired Balance (Level 3)|-30|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-10 cp) This trait is only available to neo-pigs. This uplift's brain has not been fully adapted to the neo-pig's bipedal stance and still suffers occasional difficulties with balance. The character suffers a ?30 modifier to any Climbing, Freerunning, or similar test involving balance or upright movement.||||||||
NTRAIT|Impaired Hearing|-5|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-5 cp) This trait is only available to octomorphs. This morph lacks the transgenic hearing modifications of modern octomorph designs. The morph can only hear low sounds in the 400-1,000 Hertz range (as opposed to the 20-20,000 Hertz range enjoyed by most transhumans) and hears poorly when not underwater. Apply a ?30 modifier to any hearing-based Perception Tests. At the gamemaster's discretion, certain medium and high-frequency sounds may be inaudible as they are outside the morph's range. This lack of hearing may be compensated for with audio implants or microphones and mesh inserts.||||||||
NTRAIT|Impaired Linguistics (Level 1)|-10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-10 cp) This trait is only available to uplifts. This uplift's particular brain structure has difficulty processing language. At Level 1, the uplift loses some of their ability to speak, read, and comprehend things spoken by others when they suffer from stress. Each time the uplift suffers a trauma, they must make a Language Test at ?10 to speak (both verbal and via mesh inserts) or comprehend (reading or listening) anything above the most basic words and information. This test only needs to be made once for each language, but for each additional trauma suffered, the test must be made again, with an additional cumulative ?10 modifier. If the uplift loses their language abilities, they will recover them when that particular trauma is healed. In the meantime, they can only convey and understand basic, one-word, one-syllable concepts, such as eat or run. ||||||||
NTRAIT|Impaired Linguistics (Level 2)|-20|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-20 cp) This trait is only available to uplifts. This uplift's particular brain structure has difficulty processing language. The uplift's language centers are permanently hobbled. Their free natural Language skill at character creation is 40 + INT, and no Language skill may be raised above 60. Additionally, they must make make a Language Test to convey or comprehend particularly complex information or sentences at a ?10 modifier. At the gamemaster's discretion, this may also impair other skill tests, particularly Knowledge skills when dealing with detailed data or specialist terminology. Level 2 does not incorporate Level 1 effects.||||||||
NTRAIT|Incompetent|-10|Ego|NONE|NONE|TRUE|FALSE|(-10 cp) The character is completely incapable of performing a particular chosen active skill, no matter any training they may receive. They may not buy this skill during character creation or later advancement, and the modifier for defaulting to the linked aptitude of this particular skill is -10. This may not be used for exotic weapon skills, and should be used for a skill that could be of use to the character. (Note: this restriction is not accounted for by the skill calculator.)||||||||
NTRAIT|Intense Relationship|-10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-10 cp) Many characters retain close relationships with family, friends, and lovers. Sometimes, however, the interpersonal connection in these relationships becomes so intense as to be a detriment. The character is emotionally dependent on their relationship with a particular NPC to the point that being separated from the NPC is taxing. Each week the character goes without mean- ingful communication with the NPC, they suffer 1 point of stress. If cut off for more than two weeks, they also suffer a -10 modifier to all Task Actions until they are able to reconnect, as they are too distracted to focus. The character also suffers double the stress from witnessing the NPC being hurt or killed. Basic operational security dictates that the character cannot tell the NPC anything about Firewall nor can they communicate with the NPC during a Firewall mission. Characters breaking these rules put the lives of their friends and family at risk. Gamemasters should have enemies of Firewall use friends and family against characters who break these rules.||||||||
NTRAIT|Lost Fork|-5|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-5 cp) A fork of the character has gone missing without a trace. The fork was legal and in compliance with all relevant laws and standards-then it vanished. The version that disappeared was an alpha fork, a complete recent copy of the character's ego that possesses sensi- tive knowledge about all aspects of the character's life. Players and gamemasters should discuss this trait before using it in their game and address the following questions: When did the disappearance occur? Why was the fork created? What was the fork doing just before the disappearance? What leads, if any, does the player possess at the start of the game? This trait is often taken in combination with the Edited Memories, Enemy, and/or On the Run traits.||||||||
NTRAIT|Low Pain Tolerance|-20|Ego,Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-20 cp) Pain is the character's enemy. The character has a very low threshold for pain tolerance and is more severely impaired when suffering. Increase the modifier for each wound take by an additional -10 (so the character suffers -20 with one wound, -40 with another, and -60 with a third). Additionally, the character suffers a -30 modifier on any test involving pain resistance. This morph version of this trait is only available for biomorphs.||||||||
NTRAIT|Mental Disorder|-10|Ego|NONE|NONE|TRUE|TRUE|(-10 cp) You have a psychological disorder from a previous traumatic experience in your life. Choose one of the disorders.||||||||
NTRAIT|Modified Behavior (Level 1)|-5|Ego|NONE|NONE|TRUE|FALSE|(-5 cp) The character has been conditioned via time-accelerated behavioral control psychosurgery. This is common among ex-felons, who have been conditioned to respond to a specific idea or activity with vehement horror and disgust, but may have occurred for some other reason or even been self-inflicted. At Level 1, the chosen behavior is either limited or boosted. This trait should only be allowed for behaviors that are either limited or, if encouraged, impact the character in a negative way.||||||||
NTRAIT|Modified Behavior (Level 2)|-10|Ego|NONE|NONE|TRUE|FALSE|(-10 cp) The character has been conditioned via time-accelerated behavioral control psychosurgery. This is common among ex-felons, who have been conditioned to respond to a specific idea or activity with vehement horror and disgust, but may have occurred for some other reason or even been self-inflicted. At Level 2 the behavior is either blocked or encouraged. This trait should only be allowed for behaviors that are either limited or, if encouraged, impact the character in a negative way.||||||||
NTRAIT|Modified Behavior (Level 3)|-15|Ego|NONE|NONE|TRUE|FALSE|(-15 cp) The character has been conditioned via time-accelerated behavioral control psychosurgery. This is common among ex-felons, who have been conditioned to respond to a specific idea or activity with vehement horror and disgust, but may have occurred for some other reason or even been self-inflicted. At Level 3 the behavior is expunged or enforced. This trait should only be allowed for behaviors that are either limited or, if encouraged, impact the character in a negative way.||||||||
NTRAIT|Morphing Disorder (Level 1)|-10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-10 cp) Adapting to new morphs is particularly challenging for this character. The character suffers a -10 modifier on Integration Tests and Alienation Tests.||||||||
NTRAIT|Morphing Disorder (Level 2)|-20|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-20 cp) Adapting to new morphs is particularly challenging for this character. The character suffers a -20 modifier on Integration Tests and Alienation Tests.||||||||
NTRAIT|Morphing Disorder (Level 3)|-30|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-30 cp) Adapting to new morphs is particularly challenging for this character. The character suffers a -30 modifier on Integration Tests and Alienation Tests.||||||||
NTRAIT|Neural Damage|-10|Ego|NONE|NONE|TRUE|FALSE|(-10 cp) The character has suffered some type of neurological damage that simply cannot be cured. The affliction is now part of the character's ego and remains with them even when remorphing. This damage may have been inherited, it may have resulted from a poorly designed morph or implant, or it may have been inflicted by one of the TITAN nanovirii that targeted neural systems during the Fall. The gamemaster and player should agree on a specific disorder appropriate to their game. Some possibilities are: \nPartial aphasia (difficulty communicating or using words) \nColor blindness \nAmusica (inability to make or understand music) \nSynaesthesia \nLogorrhoea (excessive use of words) \nLoss of face recognition \nLoss of depth perception (double range modifiers) \nRepetitive behavior \nMood swings \nThe inability to shift attention quickly \nThe gamemaster may decide to inflict modifiers resulting from this affliction as appropriate.||||||||
NTRAIT|Not a Team Player|-10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-10 cp) This character is socially awkward, self-centered, or has such low self esteem that they simply do not work well others. The character does not benefit from teamwork bonuses when others try to aid them, and if they attempt to aid someone else (whether voluntarily or forced), they will apply a -10 modifier to the test rather than aiding with a +10.||||||||
NTRAIT|Oblivious|-10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-10 cp) The character is particularly oblivious to events around them or anything other than what their attention is focused on. They suffer a -10 modifier to Surprise Tests and their modifier for being Distracted is -30 rather than the usual -20 (see Basic Perception).||||||||
NTRAIT|On the Run|-10|Ego|NONE|NONE|TRUE|FALSE|(-10 cp) The character is wanted by the authorities of a particular habitat/station or faction, who continue to actively search for the character. They either committed a crime or somehow displeased someone in power. The character deals with that faction in question at their own risk, and may occasionally be forced to deal with bounty hunters.||||||||
NTRAIT|Overwhelmed By Emotions|-10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-10 cp) (AGIs Only) This trait is only available to AGIs. The character has a particularly difficult time adjusting to hormonal urges and emotions when sleeved in biomorphs. The character suffers a -10 modifier when resisting any form of emotional manipulation, including Intimidation and most Persuasion Tests. Additionally the character suffers a -10 modifier to Stress Tests involving emotions, fear, or pain. At the gamemaster's discretion, certain intense emotions or rushes may temporarily overwhelm the character; if they fail a WIL x 3 Test, they are disoriented and must spend a Complex Action to regain their wits. Gamemasters should not allow this trait for characters that are unlikely to ever sleeve into biomorphs-or should at least occasionally put them in situations that force them into one. Endocrine control does not completely mitigate these effects, though some of the modifiers may cancel out.||||||||
NTRAIT|Phobia Disorder|-10|Ego|NONE|NONE|TRUE|TRUE|(-10 cp) Phobias are a minor type of mental anxiety disorder based on an irrational fear of a particular situation or thing. Phobic characters will go to great lengths to avoid their particular fear-they must make a WIL x 3 Test to even stay within proximity, otherwise they will flee the area. If forced into close proximity with their fear, they will suffer 1 SV per hour and take a -10 modifier to all of their actions. If they are trapped in close proximity to the source of their fear, they will suffer (1d10 / 2) SV per hour and take a -30 modifier to all actions. Luckily, phobias are easier to treat than other disorders. The base timeframe for psychotherapy treatment of a phobia is 20 hours. Phobia disorders may be inflicted on characters that suffer too many traumas in place of other mental disorders. Gamemasters should keep in mind, however, that phobias are easier to treat; though the possibility of taking more mental stress from the phobia may offset this. At the gamemaster's discre- tion, temporary phobias can be used as derange- ments inflicted with mental trauma (p. 209, EP). In these situations, the phobia should be linked to the particular source of trauma. For example, a character who suffers a trauma from remembering their death after vacuum exposure might pick up a derangement phobia of vacuum environments.||||||||
NTRAIT|Poorly Socialized|-10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-10 cp) This trait is most common among AGIs and uplifts, but can be taken by anyone. The character's early life experience left them poorly prepared for interacting with the general public, and they come off as boorish, distant, or strange until they get to know someone well. Due to the difficult nature of the character's behavior, they suffer a -10 modifier on all Social Skill Tests whenever the character is interacting with another character for the first time only.||||||||
NTRAIT|Psi Vulnerability|-10|Ego,Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-10 cp) Something about the character's mind makes them particularly vulnerable to psi attack. They suffer a -10 modifier when resisting such attacks. The morph version of this trait may only be taken by biomorphs.||||||||
NTRAIT|Real World Naievite|-10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-10 cp) Due to their background, the character has very limited personal experience with the real (physical) worldor they have spent so much time in simulspace that their functioning in real life is impaired. They lack an understanding of many physical properties, social cues, and other factors that people with standard human upbringings take for granted. This lack of common sense may lead the character to misunderstand how a device works or to misinterpret someones body language. Once per game session, the gamemaster may intentionally mislead the character when giving them a description about some thing or some social interaction. This falsehood represents the characters misunderstanding of the situation, and should be roleplayed appropriately, even if the player realizes the characters mistake. This trait should only be available to characters with the infolife or re-instantiated backgrounds, though the gamemaster may allow it for characters who have extensive virtual reality/XP use in their personal histories.||||||||
NTRAIT|Shut In|-15|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-15 cp) This character is a social hermit or went through a period of self-imposed isolation, limiting the amount of interactions they have via online social networks. Because the character is out of touch, their ability to network with others is impaired. Apply a ?10 modifier to Networking Tests.||||||||
NTRAIT|Slow Learner|-10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-10 cp) New skills are not easy for this character to pick up. The character takes twice as long as normal to improve skills or learn new ones.||||||||
NTRAIT|Social Stigma|-10|Ego,Morph|NONE|NONE|TRUE|TRUE|(-10 cp) An unfortunate aspect of the character's background means that they suffer from a stigma in certain social situations. They may be sleeved in a morph viewed with repugnance, be a survivor of the infamous Lost generation, or may be an AGI in a post-Fall society plagued by fear of artificial intelligence. In social situations where the character's nature is known to someone who view that nature with distaste, fear, or repugnance, they suffer a -10 to -30 modifier (gamemaster's discretion) to social skill tests.||||||||
NTRAIT|Socially Graceless|-10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-10 cp) Something about the character makes them a walking social disaster. While the character can be charming and confident, they forget basic social etiquette, overlook customs and rules, miss social cues, and overstep their bounds. Once per game session, the gamemaster can treat one social interaction (prefer- ably where a Social Skill Test by the character was involved) as a critical failure. Usually this results in someone being offended, becoming hostile, or refusing to work with the character. Protocol may not be used to wipe away this social gaffe, nor may Moxie negate it.||||||||
NTRAIT|Solitary|-10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-10 cp) (Neo-Octopi Only) This trait is only available to neo-octopi uplifts. Like its pre-sapient kin, this uplift prefers solitude and has not been fully socialized. As a result, they can only tolerate 2 hours of direct interaction (physical or virtual) with others before they need a break and some alone time (at least 2 hours). If forced into a situation where they must interact or exist in close proximity to others for more than 2 hours, they suffer a cumulative -10 modifier to all Social Skill Tests per 2-hour period, up to a maximum of -30. After 6 hours, they must a WIL x 3 Test to keep their composure and not react towards those around them with aggression, hostility, or even violence. This trait is usually taken in conjunction with the Hardening (Isolation) trait.||||||||
NTRAIT|Stalker|-10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-10 cp) A voyeur obsessively stalks this character's actions online. The gamemaster and player should work out details of the stalker together, and the gamemaster should use the stalker as a plot element to create occasional nuisances and challenges. The stalker could, for example, be a fan who over-appreciates the character's work and pesters them or a unknown entity that follows the character's actions religiously and posts the details to an online log.||||||||
NTRAIT|Stolen Identity|-10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-10 cp) Someone stole this character's identity and took advantage of their name, reputation, background-the works. Though this happened in the past, the situation was never fully resolved and the character is plagued with collateral difficulties from the theft. The gamemaster and player should work out details of the incident together, and the gamemaster should use this to occasionally hinder the character or create complications. For example, the character may have to deal with criminal charges against them in one habitat, angry thugs looking for payback on another, and so on.||||||||
NTRAIT|Submissive|-5|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-5 cp) This trait is only available to uplifts. This character retains a tendency to submit to displays of domi- nance, inherited from their pre-sapient forebears. The character suffers a -20 modifier in Opposed Tests against Intimidation from NPCs with perceived social status.||||||||
NTRAIT|Subverted Mind|-30|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-30 cp) Similar to the Modified Behavior trait (p. 150, EP), the character has been conditioned by behavioral control psychosurgery-in this case, an expunged or enforced behavior. The character is unaware of this mind editing, however, as the procedure also included an awareness block (p. 170). This means the character could be a secret spy, courier, or saboteur, possibly even regularly engaging in behavior of which they are completely unaware. Alternatively, they could simply be an enemy's secret ace in the hole, a trump card to exploit when the time is right. Keep in mind that, due to the awareness block, even when the character's hidden programming becomes apparent to others, they will be cognitively incapable of recognizing it themselves, which is certain to be an incredibly stressful experience all around.||||||||
NTRAIT|Timid|-10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-10 cp) This character frightens easily. They suffer a -10 modifier when resisting fear or intimidation.||||||||
NTRAIT|Trusting Heart|-10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-10 cp) The character has a tendency to trust others far too quickly and is devastated when betrayed. Stress loss from betrayal is doubled and the character suffers a -10 modifier when using Kinesics in Opposed Tests against Deception or Impersonation skills.||||||||
NTRAIT|Uncontrollable Urge|-10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-10 cp) The ego or morph has an overwhelming primal drive that is not properly filtered by the brain, such as the urge for hunting, hiding food, mating, marking territory, driving off competitors (or, for the rare synthmorph, cleaning, serving, or shutting down when not in use), and so on. When presented with triggering stimuli, the character must pass a WIL x 3 Test to resist acting out the compulsion immediately. While resisting the compulsion, the character suffers a -10 to all actions. Uncontrollable drives are poorly received in most circles. This trait is most common among uplifts.||||||||
NTRAIT|VR Vertigo|-10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-10 cp) The character experiences intense vertigo and nausea when interfacing with any type of virtual reality, XP, or simulspace. Augmented reality has no effect, but VR inflicts a -30 modifier to all of the character's actions. Prolonged use of VR (gamemaster's discretion) may actually incapacitate the character should they fail a WIL x 2 Test.||||||||
NTRAIT|Wait, That Was You?|-10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-10 cp) This character was the unfortunate star of a viral meme that swept through the solar system's mesh networks-provoking anger, disgust, or mockery towards them. To this day, strangers who access the character's social profile are likely to connect them to that meme, coloring their perception of the character. Once per game session, the gamemaster may decide that a stranger with whom the character is interacting and who has access to the character's online public profile makes the connection. The character suffers a one-time ?20 modifier to any social skill or Networking Test with that stranger.||||||||
NTRAIT|Zero-G Nausea|-10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(-10 cp) This morph suffers from space sickness and does not fair well in zero-gravity. The character suffers a -10 modifier in any microgravity climate. Additionally, whenever the character is first getting acclimated or anytime they must endure excessive movement in microgravity, they must make a WIL Test or spend 1 hour incapacitated by nausea per 10 points of MoF.||||||||
PTRAIT|Adaptability (Level 1)|10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(10 cp) Resleeving is a breeze for this character. They adjust to new morphs much more quickly than most other people. Apply a +10 modifier for Integration Tests (p. 271) and Alienation Tests (p. 272).||||||||
PTRAIT|Adaptability (Level 2)|20|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(20 cp) See Level 1. Apply an additional +10 modifier for Integration Tests (p. 271) and Alienation Tests (p. 272).||||||||
PTRAIT|AGI Affinity|5|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(5 cp) The character has spent a significant amount of time around AGIs, to the point where socializing with an AGI is far easier. The character gains a +10 modifier on Social Skill Tests against AGIs as well as characters with the Real World Naivet? trait.||||||||
PTRAIT|AGI Socialization|10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(10 cp) Only AGI characters may take this trait and only during character generation. The character is more adept at interpreting social cues than the average infolife. The character gains a +10 bonus on all Kinesics Tests made against transhumans. This bonus does not apply to other AGIs, uplifts, aliens, or exsurgents.||||||||
PTRAIT|Allies|30|Ego|NONE|NONE|TRUE|TRUE|(30 cp) The character is part of or has a relationship with some influential group that they can occasionally call on for support. For example, this could be their old gatecrashing crew, former research lab co-workers, a criminal cartel they are part of, or an elite social clique. The gamemaster and player should work out what the characters relationship is with this group, and why the character can call on them for aid. Gamemasters should take care that these allies are not abused, such as calling on them more than once per game session. The characters ties to this group are also a two-way streetthey will be expected to perform duties for the group on occasion as well (a potential plot seed for scenarios).||||||||
PTRAIT|Ambidextrous|10|Ego|NONE|NONE|TRUE|TRUE|(10 cp) The character can use and manipulate objects equally well with both hands (they do not suffer the off-hand modifier). If the character has other prehensile limbs (feet, tail, tentacles, etc), this trait may be applied to a limb other than the hand. This trait may be taken multiple times for multiple limbs.||||||||
PTRAIT|Animal Empathy|5|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(5 cp) The character has an instinctive feel for handling and working with non-sapient animals of all kinds. Apply a +10 modifier to Animal Handling skill tests or whenever the character makes a test to influence or interact with an animal.||||||||
PTRAIT|Async Familiarity|5|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(5 cp) This character has a keen sense for the subtle behavioral clues and micro-expressions that many asyncs unconsciously adopt after their infection. As a result, they may make a Kinesics Test to identify an async as such on their behavior alone. Gamemasters are encouraged to make this test difficult (-30) at best, given that there is usually no outward sign of Watts-MacLeod infection or the use of psi sleights. This trait is most common among asyncs, but it may be allowed for characters that have studied asyncs or spent significant time in their presence.||||||||
PTRAIT|Brave|10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(10 cp) This character does not scare easily, and will face threats, intimidation, and certain bodily harm without flinching. As a side effect, the character is not always the best at gauging risks, especially when it comes to factoring in danger to others. The character receives a +10 modifier on all tests to resist fear or intimidation.||||||||
PTRAIT|Common Sense|10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(10 cp) The character has an innate sense of judgment that cuts through other distractions and factors that might cloud a decision. Once per game session, the player may ask the gamemaster what choice they should make or what course of action they should take, and the gamemaster should give them solid advice based on what the character knows. Alternately, if the character is about to make a disastrous decision, the gamemaster can use the characters free hint and warn the player they are making a mistake.||||||||
PTRAIT|Danger Sense|10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(10 cp) The character has an intuitive sixth sense that warns them of imminent threats. They receive a +10 modifier on Surprise Tests.||||||||
PTRAIT|Digital Ghost|10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(10 cp) The character has an intuitive knack for keeping their computer intrusions out of the spotlight. Once per game session, the hacker may prevent a Severe Failure or Critical Failure from downgrading their status on a hacked system (see Failing Tests, p. 257, EP).||||||||
PTRAIT|Direction Sense|10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(10 cp) Somehow the character always knows which way is up, north, etc., even when blinded. The character receives a +10 modifier for _x001E_ guring out complex directions, reading maps, and remembering or retracing a path they have taken.||||||||
PTRAIT|Dominant Strain|10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(10 cp) (Asyncs Only) This trait is only available to asyncs. The Watts-MacLeod virus has a special hold on the async and aggressively resists attempts by other strains of the exsurgent virus to gain a foothold in the character. Instead of the usual -20 penalty to resist infection, the character gains a +10 bonus. Any time they must make such a test, however, they immediately suffer the effects of a derangement for 1d10 hours after the test is resolved as the Watts-MacLeod strain asserts itself. They incur no stress along with this derangement, but multiple tests to resist infection may, at the gamemaster's discretion, incur additional derangements.||||||||
PTRAIT|Drug Exception|10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(10 cp) The character or morph has an unusual resistance to addiction for one particular biological or chemical drug (but not nanodrugs or narcoalgorithms). Addiction Tests for using that drug or resisting an addiction craving are made with a +20 modifier.Furthermore, the character halves the penalty for minor and moderate addiction to that drug, but still suffers full penalties from major addiction.||||||||
PTRAIT|Ego Plasticity (Level 1)|10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(10 cp) Merging forks can be stressful under the best of circumstances, but some people handle the process better than others. Per level, the character gains a +10 modifier on all Merging Tests and suffers -1 SV when merging forks.||||||||
PTRAIT|Ego Plasticity (Level 2)|20|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(20 cp) Merging forks can be stressful under the best of circumstances, but some people handle the process better than others. Per level, the character gains a +10 modifier on all Merging Tests and suffers -1 SV when merging forks.||||||||
PTRAIT|Ego Plasticity (Level 3)|30|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(30 cp) Merging forks can be stressful under the best of circumstances, but some people handle the process better than others. Per level, the character gains a +10 modifier on all Merging Tests and suffers -1 SV when merging forks.||||||||
PTRAIT|Eidetic Memory|10|Ego,Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(10 cp) Much like a computer, the character has perfect memory recall. They can remember anything they have sensed, often even from a single glance. This works the same as the eidetic memory implant.||||||||
PTRAIT|Entrepreneur (Level 1)|10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(10 cp) This character is the owner or co-owner of their own small hypercorp, microcorp, or business franchise-or an active participant in an autonomist cooperative, collective, or work syndicate. This entity has its own reputation score in an appropriate social network; at the beginning of game play, this rep score equals the trait level x 20. As an owner/member, the character can call upon this rep score for favors, information, and goods, just as they would their own rep score. At the gamemster's discretion, this venture can provide other benefits, such as enabling opportunities for smuggling, making official inquiries, or providing a cover for clandestine activities. Though a character can handle much of their management/participation in their businesses or cooperative work project via the mesh and forking, the gamemaster should ensure that the relationship is not strictly a one-way street and occasionally place obligations on the character to take care of business affairs. The gamemaster and player should work together to define the nature of the business/cooperative, such as what it focuses on, where it is based, and the other important partici- pants. These ventures are more than just another resource for the character to call upon, as they can also be used to sew new plot seeds or create new role- playing opportunities. The reputation score of this venture should fluc- tuate during game play, much like a player character's. This may be in part due to the character's actions, but could also result from economic or political factors outside the character's control. NOTE: Add this rep as free points to the OTHER rep section after game start.||||||||
PTRAIT|Entrepreneur (Level 2)|20|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(20 cp) This character is the owner or co-owner of their own small hypercorp, microcorp, or business franchise-or an active participant in an autonomist cooperative, collective, or work syndicate. This entity has its own reputation score in an appropriate social network; at the beginning of game play, this rep score equals the trait level x 20.

PTRAIT|Entrepreneur (Level 3)|30|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(30 cp) This character is the owner or co-owner of their own small hypercorp, microcorp, or business franchise-or an active participant in an autonomist cooperative, collective, or work syndicate. This entity has its own reputation score in an appropriate social network; at the beginning of game play, this rep score equals the trait level x 20.

PTRAIT|Established Fork|5|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(5 cp) The character begins the game with a fully instanced fork of themselves, and the player can specify if it is an alpha, beta, or delta fork; beta and delta forks will have their stats adjusted according to the rules outlined on pp. 273-274, EP. Psychosurgical alterations that differentiate the fork from the char- acter such as personality edits, mannerisms, and gender/sexual identity (but not traits) can be defined by the player and incorporated into the fork at no cost. Any other positive or negative mental traits taken for the fork must be purchased and applied to the fork exclusively. The fork's morph and gear must be paid for and provided by expenditure of the char- acter's own CP and starting credits. This trait ensures the fork is established and recognized as legal in whatever habitat the character lives in when the game starts, but there is no guarantee that the fork would be recognized as legal elsewhere or that the legality will remain current once the game is underway. This trait can be taken more than once. Players should carefully coordinate with their gamemaster to ensure a common understanding of the fork's place in the game and how they can be utilized.||||||||
PTRAIT|Fast Learner|10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(10 cp) The character improves skills and learns new ones in half the time it normally takes.||||||||
PTRAIT|First Impression|10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(10 cp) The character has a way of charming or otherwise making a good impression the first time they interact with someone. This innate social lubricant allows them to more readily deal with new contacts and slip right into new social environments. Apply a +10 modifier on social skill tests when the character is interacting with another character for the first time only.||||||||
PTRAIT|Gold Star|10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(10 cp) At some point in their past, this character did something that permanently earned them a place in the historical annals of a particular faction. Choose one faction. Each time the character interacts with that faction (such as with Networking Tests) or with an NPC from this faction who knows the character, they gain a +10 modifier. This trait is incompatible with the Black Mark trait (p. 149, EP) for the same faction. Note: Not added automatically)||||||||
PTRAIT|Hardening|10|Ego|NONE|NONE|TRUE|TRUE|(10 cp) Either through repeated exposure or simply due to a willful aspect of the character's personality, the character is desensitized to one particular type of stressful experience. The player may choose one entry from the Stressful Experiences table (p. 215, EP), the Continuity Stress table (p. 233, EP), or any other specific experience that causes stress, such as specific psychosurgery procedures or Alienation Tests with a particular type of morph, with game- master approval. They are immune to stress from this source. This trait may be taken more than once, for hardening to different experiences. Each time it is taken, the character's maximum Moxie score is reduced by 1. Characters may not become hardened to the merging of forks. Characters that become hardened through repeat exposure (p. 214, EP) gain this trait for free.||||||||
PTRAIT|Heightened Instinct|10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(10 cp) (Uplifts Only) This trait is only available to uplifts. Though the character is fully sapient and normally socialized, the uplift process left much of their unconscious instinct intact, and they are able to synthesize a great deal of contextual information instinctively. This provides a marked advantage when dealing with confusing or tense situations, as the character's subconscious drives their actions and responses faster than conscious decision-making. The char- acter receives a +1 bonus to Initiative and ignores up to -10 of any modifiers for distraction when making skill tests.||||||||
PTRAIT|Home Turf|10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(10 cp) This character knows a particular habitat like the back of their hand, paw, or tentacle, having grown up there or spent years familiarizing themselves. They receive an extra point of Moxie that may only be used for tests that apply to that habitat, such as navigating the best route, bypassing airlock controls, or hacking its infrastructure.||||||||
PTRAIT|Hyper Linguist|10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(10 cp) The character has an intuitive understanding of linguistic structures that facilitates learning new languages easily. The character requires one-third the normal amount of time and experience to learn any language. The character can also learn any human language in one day simply by constant immersive exposure to it. Additionally, the character receives a +10 modifier when attempting to interpret languages they dont know.||||||||
PTRAIT|Indenture Holder|30|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(30 cp) The character currently owns the indenture contract of another ego. The person subject to indenture could be anyone from a Fall infugee to a criminal working off the damages of an assault charge. The indenture itself could have been voluntarily arranged with the character, awarded by a court, or the character could have bought it through IndEX (p. 162). The terms and conditions that will end the indenture should be clearly determined as a set credit amount, levels of favors expended, or provision of specific services. It is recommended that the contractual services are reasonably likely to be completed within 6 months. Players and gamemasters should collaborate to estab- lish the relationship the character has with the inden- ture and the exact skills and reputations of the NPC. Gamemasters should be very careful that this trait is not abused, and remember that, as the indenture holder, the character also has some responsibilities to the NPC. Physical harm, mental trauma, and illegal activities could negate the terms of indenture and may have serious repercussions for the character. Should the character treat their indenture well, they could become a trusted ally, but ill treatment could make them into an enemy (p. 149, EP).||||||||
PTRAIT|Information Control|10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(10 cp) This character has a knack for diligence and caution in their daily living, online, and social networking interactions, reducing the amount of extraneous or sensitive information about themselves that leaks out in the public eye. Apply a ?10 modifier to any Research Tests to gather information on the character or track them online (see Scanning, Tracking, and Monitoring, p. 251, EP) and any Networking Tests to ascertain the character's networking interactions (see Keeping It Quiet, p. 288, EP).||||||||
PTRAIT|Intuitive Cracker (Level 1)|10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(10 cp) When it comes to brute-force hacking, this character has an intuitive sense for finding and deploying the right exploit tool for the job. Reduce the base timeframe for brute-force hacking (p. 257, EP) by 20% per level. Since brute-forcing a system is normally a Task Action with a 20 Action Turn timeframe, at Level 1 this timeframe is reduced to 16 Action Turns and at Level 2 it is reduced to 12 Action Turns. As usual, every 10 points of MoS on the Infosec Test may reduce this another 10%; these and other reductions (such as from Speed and extra actions; p. 96) are added together before they are applied to the timeframe.||||||||
PTRAIT|Intuitive Cracker (Level 2)|20|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(20 cp) When it comes to brute-force hacking, this character has an intuitive sense for finding and deploying the right exploit tool for the job. Reduce the base timeframe for brute-force hacking (p. 257, EP) by 20% per level. Since brute-forcing a system is normally a Task Action with a 20 Action Turn timeframe, at Level 1 this timeframe is reduced to 16 Action Turns and at Level 2 it is reduced to 12 Action Turns. As usual, every 10 points of MoS on the Infosec Test may reduce this another 10%; these and other reductions (such as from Speed and extra actions; p. 96) are added together before they are applied to the timeframe.||||||||
PTRAIT|Killer Instinct|15|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(15 cp) (Uplifts Only) This trait is only available to uplifts, and is most common in those from octopus or orca genestock. During uplift the most predatory aspect of the char- acter's psyche was left largely intact, and this has left them comfortable with bloodletting. The char- acter does not take stress from committing extreme violence in situations they feel are justified and necessary, and they receive a +30 modifier on Stress Tests when witnessing extreme violence committed by others.||||||||
PTRAIT|Machine Intuition|10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(10 cp) (AGIs Only) This trait is only available to AGIs. The AGI is so attuned to dealing with machines that it has an intuitive knack for discovering the actual source of electronic or programming problems. Apply a +10 modifier to Interfacing, Hardware, or Programming Tests that involve diagnosing a technical problem or repairing it.||||||||
PTRAIT|Malleable Mind (Level 1)|10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(10 cp) Either through a natural quirk or psychosurgical conditioning, the character's neural architecture is especially malleable and more readily accepts psychosurgical changes. Apply a -10 modifier per level to the character's WIL x 3 Test when receiving voluntary psychosurgery (including neural pruning of forks). This modifier does not apply to involun- tary psychosurgery.||||||||
PTRAIT|Malleable Mind (Level 2)|20|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(20 cp) Either through a natural quirk or psychosurgical conditioning, the character's neural architecture is especially malleable and more readily accepts psychosurgical changes. Apply a -10 modifier per level to the character's WIL x 3 Test when receiving voluntary psychosurgery (including neural pruning of forks). This modifier does not apply to involun- tary psychosurgery.||||||||
PTRAIT|Malleable Mind (Level 3)|30|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(30 cp) Either through a natural quirk or psychosurgical conditioning, the character's neural architecture is especially malleable and more readily accepts psychosurgical changes. Apply a -10 modifier per level to the character's WIL x 3 Test when receiving voluntary psychosurgery (including neural pruning of forks). This modifier does not apply to involun- tary psychosurgery.||||||||
PTRAIT|Math Wiz|10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(10 cp) The character can perform any feat of calculation, including the most complex and advanced mathematics, instantly and with great precision, with the same ease an unmodified human can add 2 + 3. The character can calculate odds with great precision, find correlations in numerical data, and perform similar tasks with great ease. Apply a +30 modifier on tests involving math calculations.||||||||
PTRAIT|Minion/Partner|30|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(30 cp) The character has a personal employee, assistant, intern, or other form of retainer on hand to help them out. This could range from a hired bodyguard to a personal secretary to a solo socialite entourage. The relationship also does not need to be hierarchical; the character could have a partner or other collaborator. This minion/partner should be developed in conjunc- tion between the player and gamemaster and fully drawn up using the character creation rules, with their role and motivations spelled out. While most minions are in it for the money, and most partners share an interest or goal with the character, this NPC might also be motivated by loyalty, friendship, personal career interest, fandom, or to repay a debt or obliga- tion. For the most part, the player should be allowed to run this NPC as a secondary character. The minion/ partner is an NPC, however, and the gamemaster may take control of the NPC at any time. The relation- ship must be maintained, else the minion/partner will part ways with the character. The character should occasionally have to address the minion's or partner's own needs, which can be exploited for roleplaying and plot purposes.||||||||
PTRAIT|Morph Fever Resistance|10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(10 cp) (Asyncs Only) This trait is only available to asyncs. The async does not suffer stress effects from extended periods sleeved in a pod, synth, or infomorph.||||||||
PTRAIT|Murder Simulator Addict|10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(10 cp) Thousands of hours spent in various simulspace combat games have sharpened the character's aim and reflexes-or they've simply spent an inordinate amount of time at the range practicing headshots. When making called shots in ranged combat to target an opponent's head, this character does not suffer the usual -10 called shot modifier. They still suffer the -10 modifier for other called shots, however.||||||||
PTRAIT|Pain Tolerance (Level 1)|10|Ego,Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(10 cp) The character has a high threshold for pain tolerance and is better at ignoring the effects of pain on their abilities and concentration. Level 1 allows them to ignore the 10 modifier from 1 wound. This trait is only available for biomorphs.||||||||
PTRAIT|Pain Tolerance (Level 2)|20|Ego,Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(20 cp) The character has a high threshold for pain tolerance and is better at ignoring the effects of pain on their abilities and concentration. Level 2 allows them to ignore the 10 modifiers from 2 wounds. This trait is only available for biomorphs.||||||||
PTRAIT|Patron|30|Ego|NONE|NONE|TRUE|TRUE|(30 cp) The character has an influential person in their life who can be relied on for occasional support. This could be a wealthy hyperelite family member, a high-ranking triad boss, or an anarchist networker with an unbeatable reputation. When called upon, this patron can pull strings on the characters behalf, supply resources, introduce them to people they need to know, and bail them out of trouble. The player and gamemaster should work together to define exactly who this NPC is and what their relationship with the player character is. Specifically, the question of why this patron is supporting the character should be answered (familial obligation? childhood buddies? the character saved their life once?). Gamemasters should be careful that this trait does not get abused. The patron should be an occasional help (probably no more than once per game session at most) but is not always at the characters beck-and-call. If the character asks for too much, too often, they should find the patrons support drying up. Additionally, the character may need to take action to maintain the relationship, such as undertaking a mission on the patrons behalf. In fact, the character may only have their patronage because they are on-call or of use to the NPC in some way.||||||||
PTRAIT|Personal Connection|15|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(15 cp) The character has some sort of personal connection that often allows them to get one particular category of goods or services at a discount in most major habitats. Perhaps an old friend owns a body bank corp, their family is in the shipping business, they won a lifetime membership discount for a common retail chain, or someone in a criminal cartel owes them a life-long obligation. The player chooses one particular type of goods or services, such as morphs, cargo shipping, weapons, robots, software, implants, and so on. The character can usually acquire these goods or services at one cost category cheaper. This does not apply to Expensive goods. The player may use this trait as often as they wish, but the gamemaster may rule that is simply not available in certain settlements-their connection may not have a presence there or may be too strained for resources to offer the discount. Also at the gamemaster's discre- tion, if the character takes actions that would substan- tially compromise the relationship that enables this discount, they may be temporarily unable to use this trait or may even lose it for good. This trait does not reduce the cost of goods and services acquired during character creation, nor may it be taken in conjunction with the Tenure trait.||||||||
PTRAIT|Phoenix (Level 1)|10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(10 cp) Transhumans who die and resleeve frequently are nicknamed phoenixes. Death holds little sway over these daring characters, so the trauma of lost continuity has lost much of its sting. The character gains a +20 bonus on Continuity Tests at Level 1, and a +30 bonus at Level 2.||||||||
PTRAIT|Phoenix (Level 2)|20|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(20 cp) Transhumans who die and resleeve frequently are nicknamed phoenixes. Death holds little sway over these daring characters, so the trauma of lost continuity has lost much of its sting. The character gains a +20 bonus on Continuity Tests at Level 1, and a +30 bonus at Level 2.||||||||
PTRAIT|Potent Mind|5|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(5 cp) This trait is only available to characters that also have the Psi trait and the Psychic Stab sleight. Thecharacter's mind is especially invasive and damaging when used against others. Inflict an extra 1d10 DV when using the Psychic Stab sleight.||||||||
PTRAIT|Predator|10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(10 cp) (Uplifts Only) This trait is only available to uplifts, and is most common in those from octopus or orca genestock. The uplift retains the thrill of the hunt from its predatory ancestry. The character receives a +10 modifier on Infiltration Tests when stalking a target and a +10 bonus on the first attack against a surprised opponent.||||||||
PTRAIT|Psi Chameleon|10|Ego,Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(10 cp) The characters mental state is naturally resistant to psi sensing. Apply a 10 modifier to any attempts to locate or detect the character via psi sleights.||||||||
PTRAIT|Psi Defense (Level 1)|10|Ego,Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(10 cp) The characters mind is inherently resistant to mental attacks. At Level 1, apply a +10 modifier to all defense tests made against psi attacks.||||||||
PTRAIT|Psi Defense (Level 2)|20|Ego,Morph|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(20 cp) At Level 2, apply an additional +10 modifier to all defense tests made against psi attacks.||||||||
PTRAIT|Right at Home|10|Ego|NONE|NONE|TRUE|TRUE|(10 cp) The character chooses one type of morph (splicer, neo-hominid, case, etc.). The character always feels right at home in morphs of this type. When resleeving into this type of morph, the character automatically adjusts to the new body, no Integration or Alienation Test needed, suffering no penalties and no mental stress.||||||||
PTRAIT|Situational Awareness|10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(10 cp) The character is very good at maintaining continuous partial awareness of the goings-on in their immediate environment. In game terms, they do not suffer the Distracted modifier on Perception Tests to notice things even when their attention is focused elsewhere, or when making Quick Perception Tests during combat.||||||||
PTRAIT|Social Animal|15|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(15 cp) (Hominid/Cetacean Uplifts Only) This trait is only available to hominid and cetacean uplifts. The species of origin for these uplifts naturally forms tightly bonded social groups, and that char- acteristic has been enhanced along with their intelli- gence. Whenever characters with this background are around family or close associates, they feel a strong sense of security and purpose that grants a +10 bonus on all Stress Tests.||||||||
PTRAIT|Social Butterfly|15|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(15 cp) This character is a promiscuous abuser of online social networks. Because they go out of their way to make new connections and interact with people, they find it slightly easier to get what they need. Apply a +10 modifier to Networking Tests.||||||||
PTRAIT|Spacecraft|30|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(30 cp) Buying a personal spacecraft is far beyond the means of most characters. This trait, however, puts a spacecraft in the character's hands, with certain conditions. This trait may only be taken with game master approval and it is best only considered for campaigns where regular space travel is likely to be a major element. Somehow, the character is responsible for a bulk carrier, GEV, LLOTV, scum barge, SLOTV, or standard transport. How and why this occurred- and what strings are attached-should be worked out between the player and gamemaster. The character could be an employed pilot or captain, placed in charge of a hypercorp-owned vessel. Perhaps they are borrowing a ship belonging to a criminal cartel, hyperelite dynasty, or anarchist collective. Maybe they built the ship on their own, but placed themselves permanently in the debt of an esoteric brinker group or smuggling crew to get the materials they needed. The ship may even be stolen, with a bounty out for its recapture. Whatever the circumstances, the character should occasionally be obligated to meet or avoid the needs and demands of the ships' rightful owners, its passengers, and its crew. For example, the character may have salvaged a derelict vessel and converted it into a refugee barge during the Fall, but must now deal with the scum squatters that have effectively taken it over. Operating a ship also comes with a host of logistical issues, from acquiring reaction mass to making deals for passengers and cargo to somehow funding an inexhaustible list of critical repairs. Keeping the ship operational could become a campaign unto itself.||||||||
PTRAIT|Tacnet Sniper|10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(10 cp) If they have eyes on the target through an ally's tacnet link, the character can make indirect fire attacks with only a -10 modifier rather than the usual -30. This only applies if the character uses tacnet, not through any other means.||||||||
PTRAIT|Tenure|10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(10 cp) The character holds a tenured professorship at a university such as Titan Autonomous University or the University of Mars. This position gives them privi- leged access to the university's resources, funds, and grad assistants. The character receives a +20 bonus on Networking Tests involving the university and its staff. Additionally, favors such as goods, services, and information acquired via those university network connections are one favor level lower. These bonuses do not extend outside the university's influence. The tenured character will, of course, be expected to occasionally produce research results or other findings or pieces of work to validate their exploitation of university resources.||||||||
PTRAIT|Trauma Tolerance (Level 1)|10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(10 cp) This character has a higher threshold for handling traumatic experiences and is better at ignoring the effects of stress on their abilities and concentration. Level 1 allows them to ignore the -10 modifier from 1 trauma. Level 2 allows them to ignore the -10 modifiers from 2 traumas. Initiative modifiers still apply. In both cases, the character is also not immediately inflicted with any derangements as a result of these traumas. Any additional traumas affect the character as normal; postponed derange- ments don't count for the purpose of raising derange- ment effects, but they do count towards determining when a disorder is applied. Blocking out traumati- cally stressful experiences is a temporary measure, however, as the experience still lingers and festers in the dark recesses of the character's mind. A short period of time later (1d10 / 2 hours, round down), the character's facade of mental fortitude will crackand the -10 trauma modifier(s) and derangement(s) will kick in at one level higher. A character who ignored a trauma that would have inflicted a minor derangement, for example, will a few hours later be struck by a moderate derangement.||||||||
PTRAIT|Trauma Tolerance (Level 2)|20|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(20 cp) This character has a higher threshold for handling traumatic experiences and is better at ignoring the effects of stress on their abilities and concentration. Level 1 allows them to ignore the -10 modifier from 1 trauma. Level 2 allows them to ignore the -10 modifiers from 2 traumas. Initiative modifiers still apply. In both cases, the character is also not immediately inflicted with any derangements as a result of these traumas. Any additional traumas affect the character as normal; postponed derange- ments don't count for the purpose of raising derange- ment effects, but they do count towards determining when a disorder is applied. Blocking out traumati- cally stressful experiences is a temporary measure, however, as the experience still lingers and festers in the dark recesses of the character's mind. A short period of time later (1d10 / 2 hours, round down), the character's facade of mental fortitude will crackand the -10 trauma modifier(s) and derangement(s) will kick in at one level higher. A character who ignored a trauma that would have inflicted a minor derangement, for example, will a few hours later be struck by a moderate derangement.||||||||
PTRAIT|Untarnished Reputation|15|Ego|NONE|NONE|TRUE|FALSE|(15 cp) Through fame, a lifetime of achievement, or some lucky quirk, the character's reputation in one particular social network is very difficult to assail. Choose one reputation network. Any test to attack the character's reputation in that network suffers a -30 modifier, and any rep losses in that network are automatically halved. This does not apply if the character burns their own rep.||||||||
PTRAIT|You'Re That Guy!|10|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(10 cp) Sometime in the past, this character got their 5 minutes of mesh fame in a funny viral meme that swept the solar system. To this day, strangers who access the character's social profile are likely to connect them to that meme. Though tedious for the character, there is a positive side effect, as these strangers remember the meme fondly and are more likely to help the character out. Once per game session, the gamemaster may decide that a stranger with whom the character is interacting and who has access to the character's online public profile recognizes the character. The character receives a one-time +20 bonus to any social skill or Networking Test with that stranger. ||||||||
PTRAIT|Zoosemiotics|5|Ego|NONE|NONE|FALSE|FALSE|(5 cp) A character with this trait and the Psi trait does not suffer a modi_x001E_fier when using psi sleights on non-sentient or partly-sentient animal species.||||||||

PACKSATEMP|Brawler|10|20|15|20|10|20|10|Even in a universe of talking apes and wormholes to other planets there are always people who recognize the special skill set that goes along with a more physical bent. You've honed yourself to be able to take the greatest advantage of whatever physical gifts your morph or shell may have.
PACKSATEMP|Dilettante|15|15|15|15|15|15|15|While you've never really stood out in any one area, you've always been able to competently perform just about any task you try.
PACKSATEMP|Extrovert|15|15|15|15|20|10|15|Who needs to be tough when you can convince others to fight for you? Who needs brilliance, when smart people will fall over themselves to tell you everything they know just for a little more time with you?
PACKSATEMP|Inquisitive|20|10|20|10|20|10|15|Your natural problem-solving and investigative bent means you often notice things others miss.
PACKSATEMP|Researcher|20|15|20|15|10|10|15|Knowledge is power. The TITANs were little more than code-knowledge applied to the right places at the right time to produce power. You've dedicated yourself to a life of the mind for the benefits it brings.
PACKSATEMP|Survivor|10|15|15|15|10|20|20|You may not be the smartest, strongest, or quickest, but you've always been able to pull it together and scrape by in a tough situation.
PACKSATEMP|Techie|20|15|10|15|15|15|15|Understanding how things work gives you an edge when you need to understand how to stop them or make them work better. That's always been your gift: a way with applied information, be it computer code or life-support machinery.
PACKSATEMP|Thrill Seeker|10|20|15|20|15|15|10|You've never been able to say no to a dare, and usually your quick reactions have let you back it up.  You may not always make the best decisions but you still usually manage to land on your feet.
